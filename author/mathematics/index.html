More specifically, the ways it favours surfacing almost everything except publisher content in users’ timelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, paradoxically, a </span><a href="https://digiday.com/media/digiday-research-facebook-still-delivers-the-greatest-reach-for-publishers-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent Digiday survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates that with no alternatives of similar stature, 70% of publishers contend that Facebook still delivers the best content reach of all platforms.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75925" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-paid-or-promoted-campaigns-BORDER.png" alt="Which platform provides the greatest reach for paid or promoted campaigns" width="678" height="745"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for unpaid content circulated organically, 45% of publishers agreed that Facebook was still top dog.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75927" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-unpaid-posted-content-BORDER.png" alt="Which platform provides the greatest reach for unpaid posted content" width="678" height="745"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we sat down with our analyst Barney Perkins to work out how specifically to use the platform to your advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffer, the social media management platform, have found that posting five times a day maximises post engagement. Read more about that </span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-suggests-optimal-facebook-posting-frequency-following-algorithm/530514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, we have decided to focus our investigation on the metrics most easily monetised - reach and sessions referred to the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the algorithm changes, Facebook’s official suggestion is that post rate should not have an effect on reach. This is because the way content is allocated to a user’s news feed depends on relevance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Post frequently - Don't worry about over-posting. The goal of News Feed is to show each person the most relevant story so not all of your posts are guaranteed to show in their Feeds.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” - Facebook</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if this is true, post rate might still influence the visibility of a publication's content by diluting its average relevance and/or increasing the competition in users’ News Feeds - from the publication and from competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The below analysis looks at the daily total reach (taken from Facebook Insights) and number of posts of a publication’s Facebook page (from Social Insider). It also displays the number of sessions referred to the publication’s website (from Google Analytics). Though there is some ambiguity about whether reach or sessions are more valuable metrics, both are given equal preference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By conducting a simple linear regression of both reach and sessions on the number of daily posts, we found that there was indeed a negative correlation between post rate and reach, as well as a positive correlation between post rate and the number of sessions.</span></p>
<h2>Model 1: Reach</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75930" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Reach-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's Reach to Posts Per Day" width="678" height="478"></p>
<h2>Model 2: Sessions</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75929" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Sessions-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's Sessions to Posts Per Day" width="678" height="489"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By aggregating the above graphs, we found that the optimal number of Facebook posts per day was 11. But, make some considerations here. Firstly, the model specification is not a perfect fit of the data. In other words, it’s unlikely that had the publication started posting 40 times a day, there would be <0 reach, indicated by the red line:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75928" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-users-to-posts-per-day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's users to posts per day" width="678" height="529"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One model we experimented with suggested an optimal post rate of 16 posts per day but behaved very strangely in the extremes. As total followers increased the optimal number of posts would drop down to <1 with an absurdly high expected reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, the model we’ve focussed on here suggests that publications should aim to post to Facebook 11 times per day, with an exception for content that might have a considerably broad appeal. Perhaps questions of optimum post rate are also questions of what content is most relevant to the highest number of the publication’s followers.</span></p>

As the project progressed we discussed integration with <a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a> and the team’s desired outcomes from their Apple News channel. We were acutely aware that here was a publication described by The New York Times as ‘</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/style/the-face-magazine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a magazine that changed culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’, so with the weight of a great reputation bearing down, we were careful not to compromise The Face’s iconic brand. So, we designed an Apple News channel to communicate The Face’s position at the vanguard of British youth culture, harnessing the exposure Apple News offers by surfacing stories to users based around interests and browsing behaviours.</span></p>
<h2><b>What did The Face require?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Face aims to circumvent “feed culture” - they don't have a Facebook page and instead of posting quickfire articles regularly they deliver a small amount of content to a consistently high standard. This bold approach requires building loyal audiences that come to The Face through quality platforms like Apple News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Face’s focus is on youth culture, but one needn’t be a young person to enjoy its content. The team covers such a breadth of culture that any reader is able to quickly find an article pertaining to their interests. Unlike other publications of the same genre, The Face was relaunched as an already-influential brand. As such, its deeply-ingrained principles were well known, and the first task for us at Mathematics was assuring that they were never compromised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music, fashion, film and art are the areas most widely reported on by The Face, though the publication’s remit extends beyond the creative industries. For instance, here’s the piece leading their Apple News channel at the time of writing:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75906 size-full" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Americas-Scariest-Motel-story-on-The-Faces-Apple-News-Channel-BORDER.png" alt="America's Scariest Motel story on The Face's Apple News Channel BORDER" width="678" height="408"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This plays to The Face’s advantage in Apple News. The platform’s algorithm works to learn a person's interests, and its UI surfaces stories of interest to that person. This, coupled with the variety of its content, broadens The Face’s opportunities to appear as a ‘Related Story’ suggestion below content from huge publishers of all types. Content will also appear in a person's personalised news feed, based either on context or personal taste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The editorial team had to work doubly hard to launch with heaps of content worthy of The Face’s reputation;  the last thing they needed in the planning and development stages was more work. Therefore, it was essential that Apple News integration was as simple and as smooth as possible without interfering with the team’s hectic schedules:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We worked on setting up The Face on Apple News at the same time we were launching the website, so we needed experts to handle the integration without draining our resource at such a critical time. Because the Mathematics team have so much experience and insight with Apple News, we completely trusted them to lead the project, which they did brilliantly. They were able to handle all the tech work, while also translating our overall design identity to work on the platform</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">." - Bridget Mills-Powell, Digital Director</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, a publication so devoted to style has to appear elegant in all channels. Our </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flatplan-apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlatPlan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> integration system offers The Face the total control over the look and feel they require, in turn allowing them to maintain the integrity of their brand however they see fit.</span></p>
<h2><b>How did we ensure The Face’s goals were met?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We began by considering how Apple News can help meet The Face’s overall goals. Then, we offered their team our hard-earned insights into how best to approach growth with the platform. These conversations revolved around the various types of content The Face publishes. On its site, The Face hosts audio and video content, and it was paramount that these formats be seamlessly incorporated into the publication’s Apple News channel. As such, The Face channel on Apple News contains more audio than any other channel we've seen - an exciting new addition to the platform.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75907" style="width: 678px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75907" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Case-Spooner-audio-excerpt-on-theface.com-BORDER.png" alt="Casey Spooner audio excerpt on theface.com" width="678" height="499"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75907" class="wp-caption-text">Casey Spooner audio excerpt on theface.com</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique to FlatPlan is the ability to add custom footers below each article so we added a footer to direct their audience to The Face newsletter. This helps them own their audience, and direct them to wherever The Face’s goals must be met:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75921" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-custom-Apple-News-footer.png" alt="The Face's custom Apple News footer" width="678" height="497">All the editorial team need to do to surface stories on Apple News is publish a story to their site, and FlatPlan automatically maps content according to category, so stories are automatically grouped into the relevant section with The Face’s Apple News channel. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e designed page templates to perfectly replicate The Face’s look and feel, and built them to be effective across mobile, tablet and desktop. This assures that The Face’s content portrays their iconic branding, irrespective of platform. Here’s a desktop Apple News story:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75909" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-Apple-News-for-desktop-BORDER.png" alt="The Face's Skepta review on Apple News for desktop" width="678" height="714"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the same story on Apple News for mobile:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75910" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-Apple-News-for-mobile-BORDER.png" alt="The Face's Skepta review on Apple News for mobile" width="450" height="712"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here it is for tablet:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75920" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-iPad-interface.jpg" alt="The Face's Skepta review on iPad interface" width="678" height="849"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">From a technical perspective Apple News integration usually requires CMS-level development and heaps of QA testing but FlatPlan’s simplicity meant that Mills-Powell was able to say: “To be honest, the integration was so easy on our resource I barely knew it was going on”. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Ideal! Our knowledge of Apple News allowed The Face to make their start with a focus on building a loyal audience. It’s early days, but the team have already earned some great results.</span></span></p>

Digital distribution has shifted from newsletters to socials to messaging apps, with many consumers now shifting towards news aggregation platforms - apps and websites dedicated to the discovery of short to long-form content, all promising the perfect user experience.</p>
<p>Tech giants like Google and startups like Flipboard are playing an increasingly powerful role in the media, so building out a strong strategy to platform distribution is key. Central to this is choosing the right aggregators to distribute stories to, so with that in mind we’ve rounded up the most important aggregators below. Each can be integrated by simply providing an RSS feed from your website (a standard feature on almost all CMS's).</p>
<h2>Flipboard</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://flipboard.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75788" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Flipboard-Interface.jpg" alt="Flipboard Mobile User Interface" width="700" height="525"></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://flipboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presents news and feature content from digital publications, photo sharing platforms and blogs in a magazine-influenced format which allows users to ‘flip’ through stories easily. </span><a href="https://blog.parse.ly/post/6269/flipboard-mobile-referrer-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the fourth highest traffic driver on mobile and tablet for sites in the </span><a href="https://www.parse.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parse.ly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> network, Flipboard’s interface was tailored to engage users with a high intent to consume editorial content, which tends to drive good quality traffic back to publication websites. Flipboard monetises through advertising in-app, with ad units and native stories sitting alongside editorial content.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75790" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Top-15-traffic-sources-to-parse.ly_.png" alt="Top 15 traffic sources to parse.ly" width="700" height="866"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users are invited to indicate their interests so that Flipboard can group content accordingly. They may also save stories into their own Flipboard ‘magazines’ and access stories liked and read by friends, as the app sources content from Facebook and Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://digiday.com/media/flipboard-reaches-145-million-monthly-users-following-february-ad-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">145 million monthly users as of August 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Flipboard requires a standard RSS feed to ingest publisher content, but with a few modifications, publishers can attract more visibility on the platform. For a more detailed exploration into why a Flipboard integration is worth your while, take a look at our </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flipboard-the-complete-publishers-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publishers’ guide to the platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Phone<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price</strong>: free<br></span><a href="https://about.flipboard.com/forpublishers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Click here to integrate</b></a></p>
<h2>Feedly</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75791" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Feedly-User-Interface.png" alt="Feedly Desktop User Interface" width="700" height="454"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedly allows users to organise news publishers’ RSS feeds, combining them with social media feeds, and funnelling them to suggest content by interest. Stories can be arranged at the reader's discretion, and the app’s minimalist presentation is ‘optimised for productivity’. Users can search for articles of interest, save them to their ‘Read Later’ tab (which is also compatible with Evernote, Pocket and Instapaper), share articles to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest, and discover new voices on their ‘Discover’ page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers can decide whether to showcase content through a full feed (full text and multimedia content consumed within the app) or a partial feed (only showing limited text, inviting readers to browse the full story on your website). How you do this depends on your goals as a publisher - the full feed will offer a better experience to readers in-app which could increase brand affinity and open up opportunity to monetise through articles in-feed, whereas a truncated feed offers referral traffic to your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS 6.0 or later (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch), Android 2.3 or later, browser<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price</strong>: free<br></span><a href="https://feedly.com/publishers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Click here to integrate</b></a></p>
<h2>Apple News</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75813" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-User-Interface.png" alt="Apple News Desktop App User Interface" width="700" height="562"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple News</a> is a news aggregator developed by - you guessed it - Apple, for its iOS, watchOS and macOS operating systems. Users have stories recommended by Apple News’ algorithm according to how in-app habits portray their interests, but the platform also has a human editorial team. It’s their job to populate the app’s Top Stories and Editors’ Picks pages with eye-catching, well written articles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News is now available on around 1.4 billion devices around the world, and according to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, some 5 billion articles are read on the app each month. As traffic continues to grow it’s clear that a solid audience is available in the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 90 million users are on the app every month and its prominence, user experience and clever use of notifications make it the primary news and content source for many. Its algorithms keep access to this audience democratic and not restricted to top-tier publications. A great example of this is the recirculation area below stories, that regularly recommends articles from small publications directly below content from internationally-renowned news brands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full integration requires publishers to deliver stories in Apple News Format, which FlatPlan is able to achieve through an RSS feed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more detailed arguments in favour of Apple News integration, see </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/5-reasons-to-get-your-publication-on-apple-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we recently published on our site. Once you’ve integrated, you may find our </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/apple-news-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guide to tracking your progress with the platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> useful.</span></p>

<h2>Google News</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75814 size-full" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Google-News-User-Interface.png" alt="Google News Mobile User Interface" width="1000" height="419"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://news.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google News</a> is Google’s aggregation platform, which ingests publishers’ content via RSS or Atom feeds. It’s currently watching in excess of 65,000 news sources, making it one of the most far-reaching and populous news aggregators available today. Like its competitors, Google News analyses the tastes and behaviours of users to serve them content catered to their unique interests. It differentiates itself from its competitors by providing a timeline of the development of a news story built on content from different publishers. This allows users to track the progress of significant events over time. With over 60 nation-specific editions, Google News is considered one of the finest news aggregators on the market today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers should know that Google News’ algorithms “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses the best of artificial intelligence to find the best of human intelligence - the great reporting done by journalists around the globe.” In other words, Google News stories feature prominent publisher branding and private monetisation opportunities for publishers, including advertising and streamlined subscription sales.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, Google News is favoured by publishers as it gives them a fair chance at getting their content noticed, getting paid, and suppressing misinformation.</span></p>

<h2>Kinzen</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75815" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Kinzen-User-Interface.jpeg" alt="Kinzen Mobile User Interface" width="700" height="464"></p>
<p><a href="https://kinzen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a news aggregation platform that utilises machine learning to allow a user to take control of their news consumption routine. That’s what they see, when they see it, how much of it they see. Kinzen hopes to “make users empowered, giving you the ability to construct some form of filter and ranking system that reflects your intentions and not your instincts.” This occurs as users can respond positively or negatively to news that appears in Kinzen’s topic channels. Also, users can integrate their Twitter feeds, and the algorithm will watch topics they follow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other aggregation platforms, Kinzen claim they don’t “rank news and information on the basis of what your social network is thinking. We offer an empowering personal news routine based on the best intentions of members rather than empty clicks, likes or hearts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a publisher, you might rightly wonder why you should spend time integrating with an app that charges users for content you already provide for free. The value of Kinzen is in how it creates a news routine uniquely aligned to the daily needs of its users. This creates enormous value for the app itself, which could lead to regular usage, and potentially, a new swathe of returning visitors to your content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for generating revenue for your publication, Kinzen make the following claim on their site:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not rely on advertising. In the Kinzen app, we do recommend publisher content that contains advertising, but take no cut from the revenue. Instead, we are actively working with publishers big and small to develop revenue models based on direct support from members.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on Kinzen, please refer to </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/a-look-at-responsible-news-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which we have a chat with CEO and co-founder Mark Little. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS, Windows, Desktop<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price</strong>: Limited range of channels and controls for free, then €/$5 per month or €/$49.99 per year for premium features<br></span><a href="https://kinzen.com/publishers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Click here to integrate</b></a></p>
<h2>Inoreader</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75816" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Inoreader-User-Interface.png" alt="Inoreader Mobile User Interface" width="600" height="1110"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New on the scene but billed as a competitor to Flipboard, <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inoreader</a> is already worth considering working with. Especially when publishers consider the benefits it offers a user that other platforms don’t the same benefits which we expect will see it become a major player. Conveniently, Inoreader has a night mode so users can read content in the dark without straining their eyes. Content can even be exported and sent to friends who don’t use the app. Inoreader, it seems, thought of everything!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inoreader is RSS-friendly for browsers and devices that run iOS and Android. Fans of Flipboard will find plenty to love in this aggregator app. The ‘Dive’ feature divides content according to the topic, allowing users to build their own feeds based on what they want to see. They’re also able to save content they won’t have time to read until later. All this happens with visual components, usually images, the centerpiece of each listed story. This decision makes Inoreader intuitive and pleasant to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS, Windows, Desktop<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price</strong>: free<br></span><a href="https://blog.inoreader.com/category/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Click here for more information</b></a></p>
<h2>SmartNews</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first click on a <a href="https://www.smartnews.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartNews</a> article always brings the user to the publisher’s site. Publishers may also place advertising in SmartNews’ dedicated platform SmartView, and keep 100% of the revenue. Partner publishers are granted access to SmartNews Insights, the platform’s own online dashboard providing in-depth analysis on traffic, social sharing and key content metrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its intuitive channels such as Top News, Politics and Sport, and its publisher hubs for individual titles, SmartNews boasts its unique Channel Plus feature. Channel Plus allows users to add additional tabs dedicated specifically to content from their favorite sources, giving publishers another way to engage their audience through SmartNews’ simple user interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Summer, announced that it has reached more than 10 million monthly active users in the U.S. and Japan, and with a 200% user increase year-on-year in the US since its 2014 launch in the country, this user base looks set to increase exponentially. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crucially, <a href="https://app.getpocket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket</a> differentiates itself by prioritising ‘Save For Later’, a feature that allows users to read content in Pocket offline. As such, Pocket functions as an aggregator run by the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket prides itself on making a virtue of long-read material. Founder Nate Weiner </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-09/pocket-s-30-million-users-are-great-for-publishers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “Sharing something with a crazy headline isn’t going to make it prominent in Pocket. Our platform just isn’t set up that way. It’s a lot slower”. In 2019, Pocket and its 30 million strong user base were bought by Mozilla, whose Firefox browser now features a prominent Pocket save-for-later button at the top of the window by default. Since this Firefox integration, Pocket has sent publishers in parse.ly’s network 75% more traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket’s Pocket For Publishers dashboard is a suite of free features that help publishers get the most from the app. Trends is an intuitive set of analytics tools that allow publishers to track their content’s progress in the app, Custom Messages allows publishers to create original content that appears whenever an article is saved to Pocket from their site, and Integration allows publishers to add a Pocket button to their own sites and apps, making saving content to Pocket as simple as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS, Windows, Desktop<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price</strong>: free basic version, paid subscriptions, starting at $4.99 per month, cut out ads and boost storage space<br></span><a href="https://getpocket.com/publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Click here to integrate</b></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.apnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press’ news aggregator app</a> places an emphasis on local, providing users with breaking news from the Associated Press and hundreds of trusted local sources. Its interface may not be as glamorous as some others on this list, but with good reason: it’s an excellent news source for users who want plain facts laid bare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local publishers should take note. Like Apple News, the AP News app aims to spotlight local publishers’ coverage of local stories that go national, as opposed to that of the nation’s biggest news titles. The app seamlessly transitions these stories to publishers’ own sites, boosting traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can customise their news feeds to follow specific topics and publishers as they appear in developing stories. Users may also enable push notifications to receive real-time updates from the app, another booster of traffic for publishers. These updates can now also be shared through Apple Watch.</span></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75820" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Microsoft-News-User-Interface.jpeg" alt="Microsoft News Mobile User Interface" width="750" height="500"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No list of news aggregators would be complete without the inclusion of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/microsoft-news/9wzdncrfhvfw?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft News</a>, formerly MSN, launched in its current iteration in 2018. The coinciding announcement said: “We work with more than a thousand premium publishers and more than 3,000 brands in all major global markets – like USA Today, The New York Times, FOX News, The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde, Die Welt, El País, BBC News, Kyodo News, and many more – to aggregate the best news, videos, photos and other content and deliver it, for free, to people all over the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest benefits of the platform for publishers is its curation process. Like Apple News, Microsoft News enlists a combination of artificial intelligence and human editorial curation to surface great content. Currently, Microsoft has in excess of 800 editors working in 50 locations worldwide, to ensure the accuracy of local reportage. Every day, Microsoft News receives around 100,000 pieces of content from its publishing partners. Its AI then scans the content to understand dimensions like freshness, category, topic type, opinion content and potential popularity. It presents it for our editors, who decide what content will receive optimal placement on the app’s core pages, like the Top Stories section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Bennett, Microsoft News’ editor in chief, said the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that a free, well-funded press is a critical part of our social fabric and are proud to partner with the world’s best news brands, offering a business model that gives people access, at no-cost, to trustworthy news and provides a sustainable source of revenue for publishers. In just the past four years we’ve delivered more than $600 million back to our publishers, enabling them to focus on what they do best: quality journalism.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you’re a publisher wondering how to boost your chances of getting featured, Microsoft News’ editorial team use the words “diverse, credible and well-rounded” to describe the content they look to promote. Diversity is important to the Microsoft News team, who carefully compose the app’s pages daily to include multiple sides to a story and believe considered opinion pieces help a user to better understand a story.  </span></p>

							<div class="t-entry-text-tc single-block-padding"><div class="t-entry"><h3 class="t-entry-title h3"><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/5-reasons-to-get-your-publication-on-apple-news/">5 Reasons to Get Your Publication on Apple News</a></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s fair to say there’s quite a lot of buzz around <a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a>. Preloaded onto all modern Apple devices, Apple News is becoming a vital platform for many publishers, but as integration hasn’t been easy to achieve in the past, some publishers have held back from capitalising on this huge new audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the developers behind FlatPlan we've made integration onto the platform as easy as supplying a link to your website, and as we spend every waking moment working with Apple News we thought we'd round up a number of the key reasons you should embrace the platform...</span></p>
<h2><b>1. The way Apple News delivers content opens up completely new audiences</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open an iPhone, iPad or modern Apple computer and you’re likely to find Apple News preloaded onto the home screen. Some 90 million people are active on the platform each month and its prominence, user experience and clever use of notifications make it the primary news and content source for many.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of key things differentiate Apple News audiences from those of, say, Facebook, Google or Instagram: the intent of the audience, and the way content is surfaced to that audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s great about this audience is their intent. Where your stories compete against a myriad of images and posts from friends on Facebook or Instagram, users in Apple News are there to read news, or medium to long-form content. This leads to strong average active reading times and makes it a great platform for building loyalty from readers. But it’s how Apple News gets you in front of these audiences that really differentiates it from search or social... </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News suggests content by combining human curation with an algorithm. Users can follow publications or interests but where Apple News stands out is how it follows user interests and suggests content from all manner of publications on both the main category pages and articles pages, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say you run a digital publication that covers movies. There’s every chance an article you write about James McAvoy could be featured using Apple’s human curation, or shown to people with an interest in movies, an interest in films that James McAvoy starred in, an interest in similar actors or any number of similar tastes built up in Apple’s algorithm. Apple uses anonymised data through search and internet browsing too, so after a short time the app suggests a very good quality of content to users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key traffic driver is Apple’s algorithm-controlled "recirculation area" below articles. Thanks to this algorithm there’s every possibility that your content could sit directly below a story from an internationally-renowned publisher with a serious readership. For example, here’s a story from the small online football publication Club Call under a BBC piece selected by Apple’s editors as a Top Story:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75758" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Club-Call-story-below-BBC-story-in-Apple-News-1.png" alt="Club Call story below BBC story in Apple News" width="678" height="730"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to read more about how Apple News surfaces content? </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/apple-news-humans-algorithms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a deep dive into the app from the New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>2. You can run your own advertising on the platform, or allow Apple to monetise your publication for you</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a common misconception that publishers aren’t able to run advertising on Apple News. In fact, the platform allows advertising across the homepage, category pages and all article pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads can be trafficked through Apple’s Workbench system, but it’s likely you use Google Ad Manager (formerly Doubleclick for Publishers) - Apple now allow you to traffic ads through your existing system if that’s what you use. 100% of revenue from your direct campaigns go straight to the publisher (Apple has no involvement in these deals), but Apple offer two additional revenue opportunities from inventory they sell: </span></p>
<p><b>Backfill</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Apple sell campaigns for backfill, with publishers receiving 70% of the revenue</span></p>
<p><b>Pooled</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Publishers earn revenue from ads that appear in between their stories in areas of the app they don’t control, such as the Today feed or in topic areas such as Fashion or Technology. Publishers share 50% of this revenue, allocated based on time spent with each channel’s articles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native campaigns can be served into Apple News as well. These can be delivered as part of your standard publishing workflow - your team just need to tick a button to send them to Apple News when they hit publish in their CMS. </span><a href="https://apple.news/A5-yIpCFdRJCZYnwytx-dFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s an example from the Telegraph - this story appears in the app the same way as a standard story, but with a native flag shown in listings and on the article.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75759" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-native-story-example-in-The-Telegraphs-channel.png" alt="Apple News native story example in The Telegraph's channel" width="678" height="328"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can direct further traffic to native campaigns with Apple’s Native units. By putting some of your client’s spend into Apple News you can direct Apple’s audience to their stories, tapping into a largely affluent audience with strong intent, in a brand-safe space. Here’s an example of native ads hosted within the app:</span></p>
<h2><b><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75948" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/A-native-story-in-The-Telegraphs-Apple-News-channel-1.png" alt="A native story in The Telegraph's Apple News channel" width="678" height="425"></b></h2>
<h2><b>3. This new audience can help you spot opportunities on other platforms</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News is now available on around 1.4 billion devices around the world, and according to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, some 5 billion articles are read on the app each month. As traffic continues to grow it’s clear that a solid audience is available in the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News data is not available within Google Analytics, but within a dashboard of its own, with stats sent optionally by email to team members daily, weekly or monthly.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75761" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75761" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75761" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Graph-illustrating-Apple-News-growth-1024x499.png" alt="Graph illustrating Apple News growth" width="880" height="429"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75761" class="wp-caption-text">How Shares, Likes and Saves within one of our Apple News channels have been increasing since their integration</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New streams of traffic are, of course, always welcome, but how you dig into this data can offer valuable insight into your content on other channels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s algorithms can expose stories to readers that haven’t performed well on a publisher website or on socials. By monitoring user behaviour when users visit an article Apple can give more reach to the most compelling content, driving spikes of traffic to stories that might have gone unnoticed elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping an eye on these stories open up opportunity to re-try seeding them on-site and on socials - tweaking headlines, images or placements to drive traffic to articles, mirroring the effect from Apple News.</span></p>
<h2><b>4. Your Apple News channel can drive growth for the rest of the business</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most publishers rely on multiple revenue streams to drive the business with each individual channel working to aid others as much as possible. If approached correctly, Apple News can work to drive value outside of the app, aiding everything from data capture to events to paywall subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at FlatPlan we bring all manner of publications to Apple News - from fast-moving consumer news publications to titles that operate on freemium models, to B2B industry magazines. Each publication has a set of goals we work to - many of which revolve around building loyal audiences and monetising those audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer guidance on how to use Apple News to achieve those goals and tools to help you get there. Here are a couple of examples. Dazed, a consumer style publication wanted to drive Apple News readers to their mailing list. FlatPlan allows them to promote this under every article.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75762" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Creative-Reviews-custom-Apple-News-footer.png" alt="Creative Review's custom Apple News footer" width="678" height="727"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, </span><a href="https://www.90min.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90Min</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> direct traffic to their main site:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75763" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/90Min-magazines-custom-Apple-News-footer.png" alt="90Min magazine's custom Apple News footer" width="678" height="728"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers can of course link within Apple News articles to external pages they want their audience to see. For instance, </span><a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> often link out to RSVP links for the regular events they host.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By creating great content and following our guidance, publishers are able to develop an audience in Apple News and then use tools like FlatPlan’s custom footers to derive value from that audience.</span></p>
<h2><b>5. You can automate delivery, opening up this new audience without slowing down your team</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating with Apple News used to be a complicated process. Publishers would need to build a bespoke system of their own to handle the induction, and they’d need to take care of their own error reporting. FlatPlan takes care of all this heavy-lifting, handling collection, conversion and delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With FlatPlan, feeding content to Apple News is as simple as clicking publish within a CMS. All we require is an RSS feed; a simple output that most CMSs contain by default. We even take care of categorising content and delivering stories to Apple News with an elegant flourish that matches brand designs to a tee. All publishers need to do is what they do best: write and design clear, beautiful digital stories.</span></p>

			</div><div class="t-entry-text">
							<div class="t-entry-text-tc single-block-padding"><div class="t-entry"><h3 class="t-entry-title h3"><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/facebook-tests-a-new-swipeable-stories-like-news-feed/">Facebook Tests a New ‘Swipeable’, Stories-Like News Feed</a></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its 2018 Q2 earnings announcement, Facebook indicated that their revenue growth could reduce significantly if users continue the trend for focussing the majority of their viewing time on Stories, as opposed to the News Feed. Its share price dropped 20%, destroying $120 billion in the company’s value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Facebook and Messenger Stories are currently only used by 300 million people a day. An obscenely large number, yet less than 10% of Facebook’s user base. Compared to Instagram, 40% of whose users interact with Stories every day, it’s a relatively insignificant bracket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, Facebook is eager to preempt what’s beginning to look like a shift to Stories. So, the company has begun to experiment with a new carousel-style layout for the News Feed, that would behave in exactly the same way as Stories. The experiment also merges Feeds and Stories into the same stream. Frequent </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contributor and reverse engineering expert </span><a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Manchun Wong</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spotted the prototype for this new Feed in the Android version of Facebook, and screen-captured her findings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1117749628340826112</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, in this prototype, when a News Feed post’s header or surrounding space is tapped, users see a full-screen version of the post. From there, they can swipe left to reveal the next piece of content in the carousel, which may be one of four things:</span></p>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional News Feed posts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">News Feed ads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vertical Stories</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vertical Stories ads</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite swiping to keep the carousel rotating, users are still able to Like, react or comment on Feed posts while in this interface.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75730" style="width: 485px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75730 size-full" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/04/Facebook-Hybrid-News-Feed-Stories-Carousel.jpg" alt="Facebook's hybrid News Feed/Stories carousel" width="485" height="680"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75730" class="wp-caption-text">Facebook's hybrid News Feed/Stories carousel</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Facebook’s News Feed engagement is in an overall state of decline - </span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-shows-facebook-usage-dropped-for-a-second-straight-year-in-the-u/550019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many reports suggest it is</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - and Stories engagement is growing, then it’s implied that users are losing interest in the main News Feed and looking elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/facebook-hybrid-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed to TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it’s actively experimenting with this hybrid News Feed/Stories approach, but also noted that it's still in the very early stages of development.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch that “We are currently not testing this publicly” as the company must still complete the user research phase before any public experimentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the importance of Facebook's News Feed slowly declines, Stories presents the most pressing area of engagement for publishers that use Facebook. To connect these two areas is to connect the area users are beginning to spend the majority of their time in with the area that, for now, is driving Facebook’s revenue. A canny move on the company’s part, and one it’s worth keeping an eye one.</span></p>

But, a group of publishers have started to undertake WhatsApp marketing strategies to explore what’s possible with the service. A western brand may call this a necessity but still feel distanced from it. But in India, WhatsApp’s most populous market, the narrative of news consumption has unfolded to make a transition to WhatsApp not a calculation, but a natural next step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a widely-held estimate that in January 2018, Indian WhatsApp user numbers reached 300 million. It may well be even higher than this today. Remarkable, considering WhatsApp has 1.6 billion monthly users internationally. Check the rapid increase in growth rate for Indian WhatsApp users:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75705" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75705" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/04/IndianWhatsAppUserGrowth-1024x875.png" alt="Indian WhatsApp User Growth" width="450" height="385"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75705" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: http://www.businessofapps.com/data/whatsapp-statistics/</em></figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-reported statistics reveal that 82% of Indian internet users are on the app, putting it behind Facebook (89%) and YouTube (93%) only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany’s another area of significant interest. According to <a href="https://www.axelspringer.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axel Springer</a>’s Hannah Schwär: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">94% of young Germans favour [WhatsApp] over other social media apps. Especially in times where it’s really hard to reach a young audience via news apps or Facebook, this is a really interesting channel.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the run up to the 2018 German federal elections, Axel Springer attempted to devise a way to engage young voters. Their in-house team created <a href="http://shotty.news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shotty</a>. </span></p>
<h2><b>What’s Shotty?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of its catchy name, Shotty is not actually a chatbot. Schwär found that commercially available WhatsApp chatbots didn’t support voice messages, a feature key to Shotty. So yes, the team literally had to manage the community by hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shotty worked on the basis that the editor and host record a bulletin at 5am every morning with a loose, conversational tone. Then, they would distribute it via WhatsApp at 7am. Most users reported feeling too lazy to read much news in the early hours of the morning, so audio fitted into their morning routine seamlessly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Schwär told Medium that without a WhatsApp-supported technical infrastructure it’ll be difficult to scale Shotty up any further. <a href="https://www.scoopwhoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScoopWhoop</a> is a great example of WhatsApp-supported infrastructure deployed effectively, allowing for indefinite growth.</span></p>
<h2><b>What’s ScoopWhoop?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013 by six friends from advertising and marketing backgrounds, ScoopWhoop is best considered as India’s answer to sites like <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Huffington Post</a>. Co-founder and CEO Sattvik Mishra told <a href="https://inc42.com/startups/scoopwhoop-growth-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc42</a> “We would go through all these sites in the US that had viral content such as <a href="http://diply.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diply.com</a> or Huffington Post or even a Buzzfeed. And we realised that this same culture was being replicated here in India.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All our publications around that time, apart from those in mainstream media, were American in nature, talking about their TV shows, their problems, and their issues. And the pop culture that did exist in India was US-focussed. So we decided to do something about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ScoopWhoop’s WhatsApp service merely requires a user to click a button and send the automatically added ScoopWhoop contact a message, and they will begin to receive daily news updates via WhatsApp. The service is automated using MessengerPeople (then known as WhatsBroadcast); an identical setup to I AM POP, which we’ve <a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/working-through-facebooks-pivot-to-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered in the past</a>. It works similarly to <a href="https://www.thequint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Quint</a>’s WhatsApp chatbot.</span></p>
<h2><b>What’s The Quint?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quint is an English and Hindi language news site founded by Raghav Bahl and Ritu Kapur. Initially, they used WhatsApp Business to distribute content with their readers. But the system restricted them to manually updating multiple 256-member WhatsApp groups, rather than one all-encompassing list. The response was overwhelming, and they quickly began to look into more efficient ways of distributing their content via WhatsApp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like ScoopWhoop, The Quint decided to experiment with <a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MessengerPeople</a>. Now, all a reader had to do was send the word ‘Start’ to the WhatsApp window, and they’d begin receiving daily news bulletins. Here’s how they look.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75706" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75706" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75706" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/04/BloombergQuintMessengerPeople.png" alt="Bloomberg Quint's WhatsApp MessengerPeople Service" width="320" height="639"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75706" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: https://www.messengerpeople.com/chatbots-what-is-a-whatsapp-bot-actually/</em></figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, The Quint tried MessengerPeople through the <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BloombergQuint</a> branch of the publication, as the content is niche; stock updates, business news, etc. The user base grew rapidly, leading many users to the site and increasing and driving monetisation. This particular WhatsApp service has over 268,000 subscribers as of August 2018. And that’s just BloombergQuint; The Quint hosts a number of other channels, such as <a href="https://www.thequint.com/neon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEON</a> and <a href="https://fit.thequint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FIT</a>.</span></p>
<h2><b>How is WhatsApp performing in the UK?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this hype isn’t restricted to India, of course. WhatsApp is performing brilliantly in the UK. Facebook and YouTube are the UK’s most popular social networks, both tied with 79% of social network users in the UK as of February 2018. WhatsApp, however, is the UK’s most popular chat app, with a social network user share of 58%. That tops even Facebook Messenger’s monthly active users. Here’s how the whole graph looks.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75707" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75707" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75707" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/04/SocialNetworksRankedByUsageUK.png" alt="Social networks ranked by usage in the UK" width="600" height="446"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75707" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: https://www.messengerpeople.com/whatsapp-user-base-uk/</em></figcaption></figure><h2><b>I’m convinced. How do I use MessengerPeople?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the ‘<a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/whatsapp-business-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Case</a>’ for users who would like to send notifications and alerts over WhatsApp. This is likely the area which digital publishers will be most interested in.</span></p>
<h3><i>Use</i><b><i> Case: Notifications & Alerts</i></b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use messaging apps to send your customers important information or updates in real-time, reaching them on their smartphone lock screen.</span></i></p>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><b>Verification</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – such as registration or login confirmation, two-factor authentication, etc.</span></i></li>
</ul><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Confirmation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – for example, booking or payment confirmations.</span></em></li>
</ul><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Alert</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – delivery status, flight time changes and more.</span></em></li>
</ul><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Reminder</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – for an appointment or an unpaid bill, etc.</span></em></li>
</ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After signing up for the 14-day free trial, here’s what you need to do:</span></p>
<ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on ‘Configure Test Numbers’ in the WhatsApp Business Test Users panel in the dashboard to save the test user phone numbers (yours and your colleagues’).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you or another test user message to your channel number (which you can find in ‘WhatsApp Business Test Users’ in the Dashboard).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this is done, navigate to the ‘Assignment’ page and assign the received ticket to any agent. It can then be replied to via WhatsApp.</span></li>
</ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on how to get started with the service, head </span><a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/messenger-communication-platform/)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing starts at €699 per month, with additional packages available according to the chat answers, agents and channels the user requires. The full price breakdown and comprehensive list of features can be found </span><a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/pricing/#1547715090799-2364e414-bbe3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s plenty of evidence that MessengerPeople is worthwhile for publishers. Mathematics spoke to International Marketing Manager Birgit Bucher, who told us:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span></i><a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/messenger-communication-platform/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messenger Communication Platform</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is based on personalized messenger customer communication. The customer contacts a business first in order to receive information and news. So naturally, there is an impressive opening rate behind that. Our clients have an average open rate of up to 90% and click-through rate of 35%.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most WhatsApp users also have the push-notification enabled, so the message appears directly and immediately on the lock screen. This ensures maximum awareness. With the help of our platform, companies were able to increase their customer satisfaction.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Our take</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, there are downsides to a WhatsApp strategy. As you’re no doubt aware, it’s not a ‘share-friendly’ platform, so requires a strategy entirely of its own, separate to that of social media channels. Also, the way that images download automatically onto users’ phones is a cumbersome frustration, occupying gallery space and potentially leading to unsubscribes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's always good to be careful when using startups that piggyback services like WhatsApp, but since changing from WhatsBroadcast, MessengerPeople has been officially endorsed by WhatsApp. It is one of the few official WhatsApp Business API providers worldwide. See </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/solutions-explorer/messaging/316098905687002/MessengerPeople"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their official recognition. I asked Bucher for clarity here and she explained “...there is no risk of WhatsApp cutting any numbers of our clients. You can read more about the WhatsApp Business API </span><a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/whatsapp-business-api-at-a-glance-features-potentials-and-costs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Mathematics, we believe the proliferation of WhatsApp presents an absolutely vital opportunity to publishers. As of the time of publishing, you have the chance to be among the first British publishers utilising the platform in this way. You should take it.</span></p>

				</div>
			</div><div class="t-entry-text">
							<div class="t-entry-text-tc single-block-padding"><div class="t-entry"><h3 class="t-entry-title h3"><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-dedicated-news-tab-so-far/">Everything We Know About Facebook’s Dedicated News Tab - So Far</a></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/vb.4/10107028374517921/?type=2&video_source=user_video_tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down with Matthias Döpfner - CEO of Axel Springer - for a discussion about the roles of Facebook and journalism in a bustling digital media industry. During their conversation, which took place in Berlin and was broadcast to the world via Facebook, Zuckerberg revealed that he was considering launching a dedicated tab within Facebook for news, which would feature “high-quality, trustworthy content”. It could potentially be introduced before the end of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zuckerberg estimates that 10-20% of Facebook’s audience would be interested in this new section. It will be free for all users, though Facebook may pay publishers whose work is featured in an effort to encourage responsible reporting. Currently, it’s not clear if Facebook would personally pay publishers or monetize this through an ad revenue share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this idea is evidence that Zuckerberg will aim to remain true to the </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/working-through-facebooks-pivot-to-privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promises made</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his recent </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding Facebook’s substantial privacy and transparency issues. Perhaps it’s a savvy play engineered to ensure Facebook can continue to compete with Google and </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/a-publishers-guide-to-apple-news-magazines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the news front. Don’t forget, Facebook has recently been confronted with new European Union </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/google-facebook-forced-to-pay-creators-under-new-eu-rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">copyright rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will require it to “compensate publishers and creators for the content that appears on their websites”. These plans could have come from a place of necessity, as opposed to genuine desire for an overhaul of practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook may hire editors to operate the news tab, but Zuckerberg told Döpfner that currently it’s unclear to what extent the content of the tab will be chosen by users or curated by editors. We do know that Facebook had to adapt its editorial strategy with trending news after being </span><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/facebook-gets-rid-of-its-human-editors-replaces-them-with-algorithms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of intentionally stifling conservative voices. Facebook was even </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-trending-news-leaked-documents-editor-guidelines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found by the Guardian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have given its editorial staff the ability to add or remove content from the trending bar, at their discretion. But, Zuckerberg went on to clarify: “We’re not going to have journalists making news. What we want to do is make sure that this is a product that can get people high-quality news.” All the same, Zuckerberg added: “I want to make sure that to the extent that we can that we’re funding as much high quality journalism as possible.” Döpfner replied, saying: “I’ve always been totally convinced that quality journalism in the digital world can only exist if there is also an element of paying readers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75685 size-large" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/04/MarkZuckerbergAndMatthiasDo%CC%88pfner-1024x561.png" alt="Mark Zuckerberg and Matthias Döpfner discuss Facebook's news tab" width="1024" height="561"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appeared that Zuckerberg wasn’t too proud to take a dig at some competition, either, claiming: “We’re coming to this from a very different perspective than some of the other players in the space who view news as a way that they want to maximise their revenue” - possibly a reference to <a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/a-publishers-guide-to-apple-news-magazines/">Apple News+</a>, Apple’s recently unveiled ‘Netflix for news’ which came under fire when it was </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/13/media/apple-news-subscription/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it will take 50% of revenue from the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area Zuckerberg was keen to discuss was local news. Facebook’s late-2017 introduction of their ‘meaningful interactions’ algorithm saw the platform begin prioritising posts from friends and families of users. This meant that only news with the most emotionally stirring, click-driven headlines broke through to news feeds. It’s highly unusual for local stories to carry the weight of scoops on a national or international level. Facebook seems to be working to undo some damage the algorithm change brought with it; proof that the promises Zuckerberg makes in his essay on privacy may hold true? Furthermore, Zuckerberg expressed a desire to make small payments to third-party fact checkers and local news organisations.</span></p>
<h2><b>Our take</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Facebook changed its News Feed algorithm to prioritise ‘meaningful interactions’, the idea of users clicking to a tab to view news would have had us up in arms. Surely, to have to navigate to a separate tab is to massively compromise content impressions? Well, it depends. The user intent of a reader would potentially change, which could exchange large click volumes for fewer users - but potentially users of a higher value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this was the case, then hypothetically, Facebook could pay publishers according to dwell time, the same way Apple News+ does. This could make for an interesting steer away from low quality snackable content driven by clickbait headlines. For some publishers this would be great news, for others it could mean the introduction of controversial practice; articles stuffed with assets that aim to keep users stuck on a page, for instance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We'll keep a close eye on best practice for the model if it rolls out. To be on Facebook’s news payroll could be an invaluable asset for publishers of all sizes and in all areas.</span></p>

							<div class="t-entry-text-tc single-block-padding"><div class="t-entry"><h3 class="t-entry-title h3"><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/welcoming-creative-review-to-apple-news/">Welcoming Creative Review to Apple News</a></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we've enjoyed the unique pleasure of onboarding <a href="https://apple.news/TWsA134eJQGOGi-emyM58SA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Review</a> onto <a href="https://apple.news/TWsA134eJQGOGi-emyM58SA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple News</a>. Working closely with the team we strived to create an Apple News channel that communicates as well as its website and print publication, presenting journalism as graceful as the work it covers, presented in an equally tasteful fashion.</span></p>
<h2><b>What did Creative Review require?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Review occupies an unrivalled position within the creative industries. Alongside the print edition, which you'll find on many a creatives' desk, the digital publication operates inside a 'freemium' framework, where 50% of its content is behind a paywall, and the other 50% is available to anybody. This model launched last year with much success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Review doesn’t provide dry, industry-only reportage. The team cover everything from art, film and television advertising, publishing to illustration, with unparalleled levels of coverage. Being part of the creative industries isn't a prerequisite to falling in love with its content. And, as their freemium model has proven, new readers who discover the publication will often convert into paying subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News offers a number of opportunities for a title like Creative Review. Apple's algorithm works to learn a user’s interests and their UI surfaces stories of interest to that user. This allows a story from Creative Review to appear under a story from, say, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a>, or within a user's personalised news feed, based either on context or personal taste. International users who may never have heard of Creative Review could end up spending plenty of time with their content, which made Apple News an enticing prospect for the team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Review is published by Centaur Media, and houses a lively, engaged editorial team and a busy development department who work across multiple publications. With that in mind, we had to make their induction into Apple News as smooth as possible and make day-to-day delivery just as straightforward, to avoid obstructing hectic schedules.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><em>As a magazine which writes about the creative industry, we have to be a bit finickity about things like the leading of type and how images sit on a page. I think all of us breathed a sigh of relief when we saw the draft templates designed by Mathematics…they got CR straight away. We think the final templates do full justice to the brilliant photography, film and design work we write about. What’s even better, is that publishing to Apple News on a daily basis hasn’t added to our work load!</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">” - Salonee Gadgil, Digital Content Producer, Creative Review.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that a publication that appeals to creatives had to be designed well. This is a team that notice and care about the exact spacing between an image and a caption, or the perfect line height on mobile, tablet and desktop. Total control over look and feel was core to the brief, as was paying attention to the finest details, to ensure brand integrity.</span></p>
<h2><b>How did we ensure Creative Review’s goals were met?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started out by listening to Creative Review's overall goals and how Apple News could help meet them. From here we offered insights into how Apple News performs and how best to approach growth on the platform. Considering the publication’s freemium paywall model many of these conversations focused around strategies to connect with readers that are most likely to be interested in Creative Review, helping the team to seed specific pieces of content to build loyalty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique to <a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flatplan-apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlatPlan</a> is the ability for us to deliver beautiful "Apple News Format" pages through nothing more than an RSS feed. This meant the resource required from Centaur's tech team was minimal, with the system now running without any need for their developers to maintain. All the editorial team have to do to introduce stories to Apple News is tick a box when publishing a story to their site. FlatPlan automatically maps content by category, so stories are automatically grouped into the relevant section within the Creative Review Apple News channel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working to Creative Review’s brand guidelines we designed pages to perfectly replicate the desired look and feel. We then built out pages to be effective across mobile, tablet and desktop. This guarantees that the work Creative Review covers lives up to its full potential, no matter the device. Here’s a desktop story:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75631" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-10.51.12.png" alt="Creative Review Apple News Desktop" width="450" height="480"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here’s a mobile story:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75635" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/04/image1-577x1024.png" alt="Creative Review Apple News Mobile" width="450" height="799"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant part of allowing the publication’s work to proliferate further was the custom footer we built. It appears at the bottom of every article, and working to the publisher’s goals it drives newsletter signups and key socials. Its sleek yet bold call to actions are tailor-made to invite conversions. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75633" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-10.51.23.png" alt="Creative Review Apple News Footer" width="450" height="483"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlatPlan’s simplicity offered Creative Review a quick and easy turnaround on Apple News. Our knowledge of the platform helped Creative Review to launch onto Apple News with a strategy driven by insights and guidance on growth. It's early days, but Creative Review has already seen huge success since launch, with articles featured in the Spotlight and chosen by Apple News editors within editorial groups.</span></p>

Zuckerberg claims the Facebook of the future will be built on several principles: private interactions, encryption (specifically end-to-end encryption as found in WhatsApp so nobody, not even Facebook, can see what you share), reducing permanence, safety, interoperability (ease of communication across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, in this case) and secure data storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Zuckerberg fully intends Facebook to remain the social media platform of today and tomorrow. But it’s easy to be cynical about this announcement if you have a basic understanding of Facebook’s business model. Facebook’s ‘pivot to privacy’ is missing discussion on its underlying business model: Facebook is in the business of profiting off user data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t sell user data to third party marketers, but it profits off it. In order to truly change their ways, Facebook has some options, but none of them are good for it as a business. They can:</span></p>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally change their business model. Not a good option if you’re making $56 billion dollars a year from advertising.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can show provide more transparency and give users more controls. But how much transparency do you provide, and how do you do it? Because these are not easy issues to explain. A lot of the world still doesn’t care, but more and more users are interested, advocacy groups are interested, and regulators are very interested.</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a quote from Sheryl Sandberg on transparency:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the problems with the business model is we’ve done a terrible job explaining it, and people don’t understand it. And when you don’t understand something, you can become very uncomfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Zuckerberg adds:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the vast majority of people would rather have an ad-supported platform for free than something they had to pay for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if these options aren’t great for business, then how can we be sure Zuckerberg will keep his promise? Particularly when trust in his company is dangerously low following the Cambridge Analytica scandal? At the very least, Zuckerberg isn’t naive about this. In his statement, “frankly we don’t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services,” is one among a few sheepish acknowledgements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is that, put simply, Facebook now intends to focus on profiting from messaging. </span></p>
<h2><b>What does this all mean for publishers?</b></h2>
<p>Moving (further) away from the news feed sounds daunting, but you’re far from the first to wonder how to make this work for you. Let’s talk about <a href="https://www.iampop.com/">I AM POP</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll notice their tagline is "Reach your audience directly on messaging apps". It’s succinct, and that really is all there is to it. Your audience can receive a message sent en-masse as though it were a friend saying hi.</p>
<p>You can even create an ‘interactive narrative’ - a feature I Am Pop boldly calls “a whole new medium for storytelling”. Boasting an average open rate of 94%, I Am Pop looks like a seriously inviting proposition for publishers, whose social news feeds are crowded, with algorithms filtering out 98% of updates.</p>
<p><a href="https://crackmagazine.net/">Crack Magazine</a> use the platform very effectively. Every Monday morning, they send ‘AM:DM’ - a collection of five music recommendations. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-75622 aligncenter" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/03/PeachPivotToPrivacy-245x300.png" alt="Crack Magazine Pivot To Privacy" width="245" height="300"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Brailey, Crack’s Head of Film and Digital Editor, was happy to share some insights on the effectiveness of the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we were fleshing out the concept AM:DM, we were keen that it wouldn’t become a feed for our own content – we already have a weekly mailer which performs this function. Instead, we saw AM:DM as a chance to experiment with something a little fresher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Essentially, our editorial team uses it as an opportunity to share music direct to our subscribers’ inboxes, first thing on a Monday morning, that will set them up for the week ahead. This could be an overlooked album from the past, an obscure DJ mix that fell between the cracks, a DIY release on Bandcamp that deserves a broader audience, whatever. Sure, this means sacrificing traffic to other websites, but for us, it’s a chance to flex our curatorial muscle and expand Crack Magazine’s editorial purview – we feel this is just as valuable, if not more so, than driving traffic to the site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hovering around a 90% open rate, and we’re gaining new followers each week, so we’ve struck a chord.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent feature on </span><a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/messenger-bot-startup-i-am-pop-raises-e2m-as-bmg-mad-decent-join-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music Business Worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I AM POP founder Tim Heineke said: “We are entering an era of post-social. Private messaging is the new social network. Users are increasingly flocking to DM, private chat, groups and stories, fuelled by privacy concerns.” Head of Growth Max van den Ingh added: I AM POP is championing the shift from newsfeed sharing to direct messaging in the music industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s absolutely no reason to suggest I AM POP should remain a privilege exclusive to those in the music industry.</span></p>
<h3><b>So how can I set up I AM POP?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before messaging your audience using I AM POP, you need them to subscribe to you on Messenger. Once you’ve connected Messenger to I AM POP via your Facebook page, you’ll see your dedicated Messenger link; it starts with ‘m.me/’. When your audience follow this link, they’ll be instructed to click the ‘Get Started’ button. After that, they’re subscribed.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do I grow my subscriber list?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest step to take is put your m.me link in your social bios, inviting people to subscribe for exclusive content, or material that your publication doesn’t otherwise provide. I AM POP suggest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating a custom Facebook cover photo too. Here’s an example from Australian musician Tash Sultana:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75623 size-full" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/03/TashSultanaPivotToPrivacy.jpg" alt="Tash Sultana Pivot To Privacy" width="828" height="315"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to engage fans in the specific way Tash has - by getting them to message you something for a specific automated response - follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Go to your I AM POP Dashboard </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Go to “Automated” </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Click on “Replies” You should be seeing the following: “Create replies to fan messages. A fan sends a message, the bot responds.” </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Click on the “+” </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get creative</span></li>
</ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an I AM POP user, you can head to the </span><a href="https://www.iampop.com/dashboard/grow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section of their site to retrieve an embed code you can use to add a ‘Message Us’ button to your own site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, it’s totally up to you to engage people however you like. Don’t rule out creating a specific post or video post announcing your new service and encouraging people to subscribe. </span></p>
<h3><b>How can I optimise my Facebook page for maximum Messenger growth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On your Facebook page, go to “Settings > Messaging > General settings” and enable “Prompt visitors to send messages”. With this switched on, the chat will be open automatically when somebody visits the page on desktop, helping convert that traffic into Messenger subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can submit the Messenger bot to Facebook to be included on their Messenger Discover tab, “where people can browse and find Messenger bots, nearby places and businesses to message”. </span><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/discovery/discover-tab"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s more information on it. There’s a lot of submissions so not everyone can be featured, but </span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/26/how-to-get-your-bot-featured-in-the-facebook-messenger-discover-tab/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s an article that’ll help you maximise your chances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget, you’re able to customise the CTA on your Facebook page’s ‘Send message’ button. We’d encourage you to experiment with this, and search for the magic formula that really helps you to drive I AM POP subscribers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Doesn't I AM POP have any competition?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course! Namely, from </span><a href="https://chatfuel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatfuel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is currently the most popular Messenger bot available. Its list of clients features some of the largest companies on the planet. It’s also not going to cost you as much money as I AM POP. For these reasons, it remains a go-to for brands looking to explore chatbots for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatfuel doesn’t come without its drawbacks: without coding skills, you won’t be able to see the conversations that have taken place inside Chatfuel. Also, when you link out to a separate webpage, there’s no data available to tell you whether the link was clicked or not. This would need to be tracked with a tool like <a href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most important, perhaps, is I AM POP’s extensive functionality. They provide a more intuitive interface and dashboard than Chatfuel, simple statistics functions and audience segmentation tools, and the potential for creativity with their various chat templates. You can even create your own. As such, we’d recommend I AM POP for professionals in creative industries; it’s a platform well-suited to digital publishers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be impartial, it’s a fascinating time for social media. Facebook’s recent controversies combined with its potential merging of Instagram and WhatsApp messaging puts significant emphasis on the possibilities of profiting from dark social, which, naturally, will become an area of primary focus. As such, Messenger could evolve as fast as Facebook’s news feed, particularly as it increases its capacity to share with WhatsApp and Instagram. All this means that the potential of what chatbots are capable of should expand dramatically in the coming years. As such, we’d recommend getting started now to stay ahead of the digital publishing competition. </span></p>

Success in publishing requires focus; allocating resource to channels that offer genuine value to the business and the audience, and being strong enough to say no to the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2018, </span><a href="https://voices.media/flipboard-head-growth-claus-enevoldsen-growing-platform-works-publishers/">Media Voices</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interviewed </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clausenevoldsen/">Claus Enevoldsen</a>, Head of Growth & Product Marketing at Flipboard<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Flipboard tends to offer genuine value to many of our clients and given its startling growth this year - Flipboard now ranks just behind Google News and Twitter for publisher referral traffic -  we’ve collated the key points from the conversation.</span></p>
<p>https://soundcloud.com/media-voices/flipboard-head-of-growth-claus-enevoldsen-on-growing-a-platform-that-works-for-publishers</p>
<h2><b>What is Flipboard?</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> is<span style="font-weight: 400;"> a news and social media aggregation tool. It presents content from online publications, photo sharing platforms and more in a magazine-influenced format which allows users to ‘flip’ through stories easily. </span></p>
<p>Enevoldsen describes Flipboard as a “curation platform where people come to consume quality content”. Their mission, he says, is to “inform and inspire the world.” Flipboard’s audience use the app both to consume fast-moving news and dive more deeply into their personal interests. Stories are catalogued in ‘magazines’ that users create or follow: hubs for the kind of content they regularly read - you could create your own cycling magazine, follow another user’s magazine about music or simply follow publications you love. Flipboard is an ad-supported platform with contextual advertisements, and Enevoldsen claims they have twice the ad recall of other platforms.</p>
<h2><b>Why is it worth our time?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipboard now boasts </span>145 million<span style="font-weight: 400;"> engaged monthly </span>users<span style="font-weight: 400;">. This doesn’t appear to be a vanity metric: Enevoldsen states that "the only way that you're really part of that number is if you have actively opened...and engaged with Flipboard in any given month”.</span></p>
<p>Enevoldsen claims that Flipboard works on a ‘publisher first’ basis - that “Flipboard won’t succeed if publishers don’t succeed”. It’s a platform-agnostic service, preloaded on Samsung devices and it directs traffic straight to publishers’ sites, allowing them to monetise that traffic in their own environment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 marked a period of rapid growth which Enevoldsen attributes to:</span></p>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A quality experience.</strong> "In this world today, it's a world of fake news, of dubious sources, and...people are really looking for this...high quality content haven”. Flipboard aims to work only with quality publishers. Their editorial teams will look to a website to confirm queries like ‘does this website have bylines?’, ‘does this website issue corrections?’. Their technical teams will vet websites for red flags such as an abundance of ad pop-ups or slow loading pages.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A shift in collective mindset.</strong> Users are beginning to become more conscious of the time they spend on their phones and Flipboard aims for ‘time well spent’, in which users can reach quality content quickly and easily.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A combination of user experience, strong algorithms and human curation.</strong> Enevoldsen describes Flipboard as "a technology company with media values”, combining a machine learning team with 25-30 editors who ensure algorithms don’t "run amok”. In the Politics section, for instance, Flipboard’s editors curate content from the left, the right and the centre equally, aiming to prevent the algorithm from funnelling one political alignment to a given user.</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.fipp.com/news/insightnews/active-consumer-mindset-study">Flipboard conducted a mindset study with Kantar Millward Brown</a>, studying over 2,000 smartphone users in the US and the UK to track motivations for opening social and news apps. Flipboard was compared to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and “...over-indexed dramatically on the motivation to invest in yourself". Enevoldsen believes that people come to Flipboard to better themselves. “There's a direct correlation between that, and then spending more time with the articles, and that's something that the publishers really value."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we at Mathematics were lucky enough to have a chat with Jessica Elsey, Flipboard’s UK News Editor. Jess handles publisher on-boarding and day-to-day editorial management; working with publications and helping them experience every potential benefit that Flipboard has to offer. Flipboard works with over 4000 publishers, content creators and blogs - 250 of which are specific to the UK - and welcome the opportunity to introduce new publishers to the platform. Here's what Jess had to say.</span></p>
<h2><b>Isn’t Flipboard’s content curation algorithm-led?</b></h2>
<p>The vast majority is, but<span style="font-weight: 400;"> one </span>crucial<span style="font-weight: 400;"> thing that Jess and her team assemble by hand is Flipboard’s daily ‘</span><a href="https://flipboard.com/@flipboard/10-for-today-k6ln1khuz">10 For Today</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ email roundup, a round-up of Flipboard's favourite articles of the day. </span></p>
<p>I’m looking at today's, and I can see ‘Is the beauty industry doing enough to tackle plastic pollution?’ on The Independent directly above The Atlantic’s ‘Growing Up in a House Full of Perfect Dogs’. It’s super varied, and quality is the only criterion. Music publishers: I’ve seen list features included, too.</p>
<p>Flipboard has dedicated ‘news teams’ in the UK and the US whose job it is to decide which news is featured in Flipboard. Once a story that covers a certain event is chosen, these news teams consult Flipboard’s partnered publishers to try to find coverage of the same story with an alternative angle. This human side to curation aims to uphold no political bias<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>So what can publishers do to get the most out of Flipboard?</b></h2>
<p>If a publisher wants their content on Flipboard, they must be aware that Flipboard only accepts RSS feeds. Bigger publications should submit multiple RSS feeds to Flipboard, grouped according to topic. <a href="https://flipboard.com/@britishgq/culture-l3n6ucusz">Here</a>’s British GQ’s Culture page, which serves as a great example. Users tend to follow Flipboard Magazines that focus on their interests, rather than specific publications.</p>
<p>In fact, the number of followers on a publisher’s Flipboard profile no longer correlate with success on the platform - historically, Flipboard didn’t have the topic system, so users would follow profiles. Now, though, most traffic is driven through topic feeds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipboard’s team can add Magazines as a recommended source on a selected topic if they feel they offer something unique, and subsequently valuable to a user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to pitch Flipboard’s editorial team content for 10 For Today, a recommended source, or anything else in mind, there’s an email address for that. The team are always welcoming and receptive to pitches.</span></p>
<h2><b>What types of content do best on Flipboard?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want an exhaustive list of the top </span>50<span style="font-weight: 400;"> most popular topics in the UK from the last four weeks, brace yourself, because here it is:</span></p>

</ul><p>Don’t forget<span style="font-weight: 400;">: while these are the most popular topics on Flipboard, they’re also the most populous!</span></p>
<h2><b>Is there anything else I should be aware of?</b></h2>
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice a significant traffic spike, it’s likely come from a push notification.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers are notified via email when their content is picked up by curators. This email is sent once the feature is live, not in advance of being featured.<br></span></li>
</ul><h2><b>What does the future look like for Flipboard?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enevoldsen states that Flipboard is already a global platform, with 20% of the audience in the US and 80% in the rest of the world. Historically, the US has been the primary focus, but Europe is now a priority - "we have a dedicated team in Europe, in the UK, that are actively engaging both with advertisers and publishers”.</span></p>
<h2><b>Our take</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parse.ly currently tracks Flipboard as accounting for 1.8% of publishers’ referral traffic, putting them just behind Google News and Twitter. We’re personally seeing relatively regular traffic spikes from Flipboard and while this traffic isn’t yet as valuable for driving loyalty as, say, newsletter traffic or Google News traffic, it’s still of a good quality for the majority of our publishers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, we’d recommend sending that first pitch to Jess and her team, if you haven’t done so already. Introducing and familiarising yourself preemptively will help you get a leg-up on the competition, before Flipboard proliferates further this side of the Atlantic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic from Flipboard clicks through directly to publisher sites, so you're able to court audiences within your environment, segment the audience and analyse behaviour to drive them from casual visitor to brand lover. Fast page speed is imperative as it’s so easy for the user to jump back into the app and find another result. Lastly, intrusive ads are a big no-no; Flipboard requests no ads on “100% of the first visible page”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipboard face significant competition from <a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a>, but being platform agnostic and publisher focused gives them significant differentiation. </span></p>
