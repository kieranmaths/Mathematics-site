    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in our industry, you’ll doubtless have spent the past couple years trying to avoid an endless barrage of gloomy predictions concerning Facebook’s ‘meaningful interactions’ algorithm. More specifically, the ways it favours surfacing almost everything except publisher content in users’ timelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, paradoxically, a </span><a href="https://digiday.com/media/digiday-research-facebook-still-delivers-the-greatest-reach-for-publishers-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent Digiday survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates that with no alternatives of similar stature, 70% of publishers contend that Facebook still delivers the best content reach of all platforms.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75925" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-paid-or-promoted-campaigns-BORDER.png" alt="Which platform provides the greatest reach for paid or promoted campaigns" width="678" height="745" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-paid-or-promoted-campaigns-BORDER.png 798w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-paid-or-promoted-campaigns-BORDER-273x300.png 273w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-paid-or-promoted-campaigns-BORDER-768x844.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for unpaid content circulated organically, 45% of publishers agreed that Facebook was still top dog.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75927" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-unpaid-posted-content-BORDER.png" alt="Which platform provides the greatest reach for unpaid posted content" width="678" height="745" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-unpaid-posted-content-BORDER.png 798w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-unpaid-posted-content-BORDER-273x300.png 273w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-unpaid-posted-content-BORDER-768x844.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we sat down with our analyst Barney Perkins to work out how specifically to use the platform to your advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffer, the social media management platform, have found that posting five times a day maximises post engagement. Read more about that </span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-suggests-optimal-facebook-posting-frequency-following-algorithm/530514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, we have decided to focus our investigation on the metrics most easily monetised – reach and sessions referred to the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the algorithm changes, Facebook’s official suggestion is that post rate should not have an effect on reach. This is because the way content is allocated to a user’s news feed depends on relevance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Post frequently – Don’t worry about over-posting. The goal of News Feed is to show each person the most relevant story so not all of your posts are guaranteed to show in their Feeds.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – Facebook</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if this is true, post rate might still influence the visibility of a publication’s content by diluting its average relevance and/or increasing the competition in users’ News Feeds – from the publication and from competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The below analysis looks at the daily total reach (taken from Facebook Insights) and number of posts of a publication’s Facebook page (from Social Insider). It also displays the number of sessions referred to the publication’s website (from Google Analytics). Though there is some ambiguity about whether reach or sessions are more valuable metrics, both are given equal preference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By conducting a simple linear regression of both reach and sessions on the number of daily posts, we found that there was indeed a negative correlation between post rate and reach, as well as a positive correlation between post rate and the number of sessions.</span></p>
<h2>Model 1: Reach</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75930" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Reach-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's Reach to Posts Per Day" width="678" height="478" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Reach-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER.png 740w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Reach-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<h2>Model 2: Sessions</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75929" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Sessions-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's Sessions to Posts Per Day" width="678" height="489" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Sessions-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER.png 793w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Sessions-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER-300x216.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Sessions-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER-768x554.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">By aggregating the above graphs, we found that the optimal number of Facebook posts per day was 11. But, make some considerations here. Firstly, the model specification is not a perfect fit of the data. In other words, it’s unlikely that had the publication started posting 40 times a day, there would be <0 reach, indicated by the red line:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75928" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-users-to-posts-per-day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's users to posts per day" width="678" height="529" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-users-to-posts-per-day-BORDER.png 783w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-users-to-posts-per-day-BORDER-300x234.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-users-to-posts-per-day-BORDER-768x599.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">One model we experimented with suggested an optimal post rate of 16 posts per day but behaved very strangely in the extremes. As total followers increased the optimal number of posts would drop down to <1 with an absurdly high expected reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, the model we’ve focussed on here suggests that publications should aim to post to Facebook 11 times per day, with an exception for content that might have a considerably broad appeal. Perhaps questions of optimum post rate are also questions of what content is most relevant to the highest number of the publication’s followers.</span></p>

    <flatplan:template identifier="default"/>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of hard work by a world-class editorial team, iconic British title <a href="https://theface.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Face</a> recently relaunched with the help of Mathematics. As the project progressed we discussed integration with <a href="http://mth.me/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a> and the team’s desired outcomes from their Apple News channel. We were acutely aware that here was a publication described by The New York Times as ‘</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/style/the-face-magazine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a magazine that changed culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’, so with the weight of a great reputation bearing down, we were careful not to compromise The Face’s iconic brand. So, we designed an Apple News channel to communicate The Face’s position at the vanguard of British youth culture, harnessing the exposure Apple News offers by surfacing stories to users based around interests and browsing behaviours.</span></p>
<h2><b>What did The Face require?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Face aims to circumvent “feed culture” – they don’t have a Facebook page and instead of posting quickfire articles regularly they deliver a small amount of content to a consistently high standard. This bold approach requires building loyal audiences that come to The Face through quality platforms like Apple News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Face’s focus is on youth culture, but one needn’t be a young person to enjoy its content. The team covers such a breadth of culture that any reader is able to quickly find an article pertaining to their interests. Unlike other publications of the same genre, The Face was relaunched as an already-influential brand. As such, its deeply-ingrained principles were well known, and the first task for us at Mathematics was assuring that they were never compromised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music, fashion, film and art are the areas most widely reported on by The Face, though the publication’s remit extends beyond the creative industries. For instance, here’s the piece leading their Apple News channel at the time of writing:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75906 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Americas-Scariest-Motel-story-on-The-Faces-Apple-News-Channel-BORDER.png" alt="America's Scariest Motel story on The Face's Apple News Channel BORDER" width="678" height="408" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Americas-Scariest-Motel-story-on-The-Faces-Apple-News-Channel-BORDER.png 678w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Americas-Scariest-Motel-story-on-The-Faces-Apple-News-Channel-BORDER-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">This plays to The Face’s advantage in Apple News. The platform’s algorithm works to learn a person’s interests, and its UI surfaces stories of interest to that person. This, coupled with the variety of its content, broadens The Face’s opportunities to appear as a ‘Related Story’ suggestion below content from huge publishers of all types. Content will also appear in a person’s personalised news feed, based either on context or personal taste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The editorial team had to work doubly hard to launch with heaps of content worthy of The Face’s reputation;  the last thing they needed in the planning and development stages was more work. Therefore, it was essential that Apple News integration was as simple and as smooth as possible without interfering with the team’s hectic schedules:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We worked on setting up The Face on Apple News at the same time we were launching the website, so we needed experts to handle the integration without draining our resource at such a critical time. Because the Mathematics team have so much experience and insight with Apple News, we completely trusted them to lead the project, which they did brilliantly. They were able to handle all the tech work, while also translating our overall design identity to work on the platform</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” – Bridget Mills-Powell, Digital Director</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, a publication so devoted to style has to appear elegant in all channels. Our </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flatplan-apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlatPlan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> integration system offers The Face the total control over the look and feel they require, in turn allowing them to maintain the integrity of their brand however they see fit.</span></p>
<h2><b>How did we ensure The Face’s goals were met?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We began by considering how Apple News can help meet The Face’s overall goals. Then, we offered their team our hard-earned insights into how best to approach growth with the platform. These conversations revolved around the various types of content The Face publishes. On its site, The Face hosts audio and video content, and it was paramount that these formats be seamlessly incorporated into the publication’s Apple News channel. As such, The Face channel on Apple News contains more audio than any other channel we’ve seen – an exciting new addition to the platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique to FlatPlan is the ability to add custom footers below each article so we added a footer to direct their audience to The Face newsletter. This helps them own their audience, and direct them to wherever The Face’s goals must be met:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75921" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-custom-Apple-News-footer.png" alt="The Face's custom Apple News footer" width="678" height="497" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-custom-Apple-News-footer.png 737w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-custom-Apple-News-footer-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" />All the editorial team need to do to surface stories on Apple News is publish a story to their site, and FlatPlan automatically maps content according to category, so stories are automatically grouped into the relevant section with The Face’s Apple News channel. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e designed page templates to perfectly replicate The Face’s look and feel, and built them to be effective across mobile, tablet and desktop. This assures that The Face’s content portrays their iconic branding, irrespective of platform. Here’s a desktop Apple News story:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75920" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-iPad-interface.jpg" alt="The Face's Skepta review on iPad interface" width="678" height="849" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-iPad-interface.jpg 2034w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-iPad-interface-240x300.jpg 240w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-iPad-interface-768x961.jpg 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-iPad-interface-818x1024.jpg 818w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">From a technical perspective Apple News integration usually requires CMS-level development and heaps of QA testing but FlatPlan’s simplicity meant that Mills-Powell was able to say: “To be honest, the integration was so easy on our resource I barely knew it was going on”. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Ideal! Our knowledge of Apple News allowed The Face to make their start with a focus on building a loyal audience. It’s early days, but the team have already earned some great results.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to Apple News, The Face!</span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The media industry has certainly seen some change over the last few years. Digital distribution has shifted from newsletters to socials to messaging apps, with many consumers now shifting towards news aggregation platforms – apps and websites dedicated to the discovery of short to long-form content, all promising the perfect user experience.</p>
<p>Tech giants like Google and startups like Flipboard are playing an increasingly powerful role in the media, so building out a strong strategy to platform distribution is key. Central to this is choosing the right aggregators to distribute stories to, so with that in mind we’ve rounded up the most important aggregators below. Each can be integrated by simply providing an RSS feed from your website (a standard feature on almost all CMS’s).</p>
<h2>Flipboard</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://flipboard.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75788" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Flipboard-Interface.jpg" alt="Flipboard Mobile User Interface" width="700" height="525" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Flipboard-Interface.jpg 1024w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Flipboard-Interface-300x225.jpg 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Flipboard-Interface-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://flipboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presents news and feature content from digital publications, photo sharing platforms and blogs in a magazine-influenced format which allows users to ‘flip’ through stories easily. </span><a href="https://blog.parse.ly/post/6269/flipboard-mobile-referrer-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the fourth highest traffic driver on mobile and tablet for sites in the </span><a href="https://www.parse.ly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parse.ly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> network, Flipboard’s interface was tailored to engage users with a high intent to consume editorial content, which tends to drive good quality traffic back to publication websites. Flipboard monetises through advertising in-app, with ad units and native stories sitting alongside editorial content.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75790" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Top-15-traffic-sources-to-parse.ly_.png" alt="Top 15 traffic sources to parse.ly" width="700" height="866" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Top-15-traffic-sources-to-parse.ly_.png 600w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Top-15-traffic-sources-to-parse.ly_-243x300.png 243w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users are invited to indicate their interests so that Flipboard can group content accordingly. They may also save stories into their own Flipboard ‘magazines’ and access stories liked and read by friends, as the app sources content from Facebook and Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://digiday.com/media/flipboard-reaches-145-million-monthly-users-following-february-ad-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">145 million monthly users as of August 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Flipboard requires a standard RSS feed to ingest publisher content, but with a few modifications, publishers can attract more visibility on the platform. For a more detailed exploration into why a Flipboard integration is worth your while, take a look at our </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flipboard-the-complete-publishers-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publishers’ guide to the platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Phone<br />

<h2>Feedly</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75791" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feedly-User-Interface.png" alt="Feedly Desktop User Interface" width="700" height="454" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feedly-User-Interface.png 2096w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feedly-User-Interface-300x195.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feedly-User-Interface-768x498.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Feedly-User-Interface-1024x664.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedly allows users to organise news publishers’ RSS feeds, combining them with social media feeds, and funnelling them to suggest content by interest. Stories can be arranged at the reader’s discretion, and the app’s minimalist presentation is ‘optimised for productivity’. Users can search for articles of interest, save them to their ‘Read Later’ tab (which is also compatible with Evernote, Pocket and Instapaper), share articles to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest, and discover new voices on their ‘Discover’ page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers can decide whether to showcase content through a full feed (full text and multimedia content consumed within the app) or a partial feed (only showing limited text, inviting readers to browse the full story on your website). How you do this depends on your goals as a publisher – the full feed will offer a better experience to readers in-app which could increase brand affinity and open up opportunity to monetise through articles in-feed, whereas a truncated feed offers referral traffic to your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS 6.0 or later (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch), Android 2.3 or later, browser<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price</strong>: free<br />

<h2>Apple News</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75813" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-User-Interface.png" alt="Apple News Desktop App User Interface" width="700" height="562" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-User-Interface.png 977w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-User-Interface-300x241.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-User-Interface-768x616.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple News</a> is a news aggregator developed by – you guessed it – Apple, for its iOS, watchOS and macOS operating systems. Users have stories recommended by Apple News’ algorithm according to how in-app habits portray their interests, but the platform also has a human editorial team. It’s their job to populate the app’s Top Stories and Editors’ Picks pages with eye-catching, well written articles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News is now available on around 1.4 billion devices around the world, and according to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, some 5 billion articles are read on the app each month. As traffic continues to grow it’s clear that a solid audience is available in the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 90 million users are on the app every month and its prominence, user experience and clever use of notifications make it the primary news and content source for many. Its algorithms keep access to this audience democratic and not restricted to top-tier publications. A great example of this is the recirculation area below stories, that regularly recommends articles from small publications directly below content from internationally-renowned news brands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full integration requires publishers to deliver stories in Apple News Format, which FlatPlan is able to achieve through an RSS feed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more detailed arguments in favour of Apple News integration, see </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/5-reasons-to-get-your-publication-on-apple-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we recently published on our site. Once you’ve integrated, you may find our </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/apple-news-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guide to tracking your progress with the platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> useful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS, watchOS and macOS<br />

<h2>Google News</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://news.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google News</a> is Google’s aggregation platform, which ingests publishers’ content via RSS or Atom feeds. It’s currently watching in excess of 65,000 news sources, making it one of the most far-reaching and populous news aggregators available today. Like its competitors, Google News analyses the tastes and behaviours of users to serve them content catered to their unique interests. It differentiates itself from its competitors by providing a timeline of the development of a news story built on content from different publishers. This allows users to track the progress of significant events over time. With over 60 nation-specific editions, Google News is considered one of the finest news aggregators on the market today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers should know that Google News’ algorithms “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses the best of artificial intelligence to find the best of human intelligence – the great reporting done by journalists around the globe.” In other words, Google News stories feature prominent publisher branding and private monetisation opportunities for publishers, including advertising and streamlined subscription sales.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, Google News is favoured by publishers as it gives them a fair chance at getting their content noticed, getting paid, and suppressing misinformation.</span></p>

<h2>Kinzen</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75815" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kinzen-User-Interface.jpeg" alt="Kinzen Mobile User Interface" width="700" height="464" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kinzen-User-Interface.jpeg 1600w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kinzen-User-Interface-300x199.jpeg 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kinzen-User-Interface-768x509.jpeg 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kinzen-User-Interface-1024x679.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://kinzen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a news aggregation platform that utilises machine learning to allow a user to take control of their news consumption routine. That’s what they see, when they see it, how much of it they see. Kinzen hopes to “make users empowered, giving you the ability to construct some form of filter and ranking system that reflects your intentions and not your instincts.” This occurs as users can respond positively or negatively to news that appears in Kinzen’s topic channels. Also, users can integrate their Twitter feeds, and the algorithm will watch topics they follow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other aggregation platforms, Kinzen claim they don’t “rank news and information on the basis of what your social network is thinking. We offer an empowering personal news routine based on the best intentions of members rather than empty clicks, likes or hearts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a publisher, you might rightly wonder why you should spend time integrating with an app that charges users for content you already provide for free. The value of Kinzen is in how it creates a news routine uniquely aligned to the daily needs of its users.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New on the scene but billed as a competitor to Flipboard, <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inoreader</a> is already worth considering working with. Especially when publishers consider the benefits it offers a user that other platforms don’t the same benefits which we expect will see it become a major player. Conveniently, Inoreader has a night mode so users can read content in the dark without straining their eyes. Content can even be exported and sent to friends who don’t use the app. Inoreader, it seems, thought of everything!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inoreader is RSS-friendly for browsers and devices that run iOS and Android. Fans of Flipboard will find plenty to love in this aggregator app. The ‘Dive’ feature divides content according to the topic, allowing users to build their own feeds based on what they want to see. They’re also able to save content they won’t have time to read until later. All this happens with visual components, usually images, the centerpiece of each listed story. This decision makes Inoreader intuitive and pleasant to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS, Windows, Desktop<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first click on a <a href="https://www.smartnews.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartNews</a> article always brings the user to the publisher’s site. Publishers may also place advertising in SmartNews’ dedicated platform SmartView, and keep 100% of the revenue. Partner publishers are granted access to SmartNews Insights, the platform’s own online dashboard providing in-depth analysis on traffic, social sharing and key content metrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its intuitive channels such as Top News, Politics and Sport, and its publisher hubs for individual titles, SmartNews boasts its unique Channel Plus feature. Channel Plus allows users to add additional tabs dedicated specifically to content from their favorite sources, giving publishers another way to engage their audience through SmartNews’ simple user interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Summer, announced that it has reached more than 10 million monthly active users in the U.S. and Japan, and with a 200% user increase year-on-year in the US since its 2014 launch in the country, this user base looks set to increase exponentially. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crucially, <a href="https://app.getpocket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket</a> differentiates itself by prioritising ‘Save For Later’, a feature that allows users to read content in Pocket offline. As such, Pocket functions as an aggregator run by the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket prides itself on making a virtue of long-read material. Founder Nate Weiner </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-09/pocket-s-30-million-users-are-great-for-publishers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “Sharing something with a crazy headline isn’t going to make it prominent in Pocket. Our platform just isn’t set up that way. It’s a lot slower”. In 2019, Pocket and its 30 million strong user base were bought by Mozilla, whose Firefox browser now features a prominent Pocket save-for-later button at the top of the window by default. Since this Firefox integration, Pocket has sent publishers in parse.ly’s network 75% more traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket’s Pocket For Publishers dashboard is a suite of free features that help publishers get the most from the app. Trends is an intuitive set of analytics tools that allow publishers to track their content’s progress in the app, Custom Messages allows publishers to create original content that appears whenever an article is saved to Pocket from their site, and Integration allows publishers to add a Pocket button to their own sites and apps, making saving content to Pocket as simple as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: iOS, Windows, Desktop<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price</strong>: free basic version, paid subscriptions, starting at $4.99 per month, cut out ads and boost storage space<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.apnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press’ news aggregator app</a> places an emphasis on local, providing users with breaking news from the Associated Press and hundreds of trusted local sources. Its interface may not be as glamorous as some others on this list, but with good reason: it’s an excellent news source for users who want plain facts laid bare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local publishers should take note. Like Apple News, the AP News app aims to spotlight local publishers’ coverage of local stories that go national, as opposed to that of the nation’s biggest news titles. The app seamlessly transitions these stories to publishers’ own sites, boosting traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can customise their news feeds to follow specific topics and publishers as they appear in developing stories. Users may also enable push notifications to receive real-time updates from the app, another booster of traffic for publishers. These updates can now also be shared through Apple Watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Compatability</strong>: iOS, WatchOS, Android<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No list of news aggregators would be complete without the inclusion of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/microsoft-news/9wzdncrfhvfw?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft News</a>, formerly MSN, launched in its current iteration in 2018. The coinciding announcement said: “We work with more than a thousand premium publishers and more than 3,000 brands in all major global markets – like USA Today, The New York Times, FOX News, The Washington Post, The Guardian, Le Monde, Die Welt, El País, BBC News, Kyodo News, and many more – to aggregate the best news, videos, photos and other content and deliver it, for free, to people all over the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest benefits of the platform for publishers is its curation process. Like Apple News, Microsoft News enlists a combination of artificial intelligence and human editorial curation to surface great content. Currently, Microsoft has in excess of 800 editors working in 50 locations worldwide, to ensure the accuracy of local reportage. Every day, Microsoft News receives around 100,000 pieces of content from its publishing partners. Its AI then scans the content to understand dimensions like freshness, category, topic type, opinion content and potential popularity. It presents it for our editors, who decide what content will receive optimal placement on the app’s core pages, like the Top Stories section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Bennett, Microsoft News’ editor in chief, said the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that a free, well-funded press is a critical part of our social fabric and are proud to partner with the world’s best news brands, offering a business model that gives people access, at no-cost, to trustworthy news and provides a sustainable source of revenue for publishers. In just the past four years we’ve delivered more than $600 million back to our publishers, enabling them to focus on what they do best: quality journalism.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you’re a publisher wondering how to boost your chances of getting featured, Microsoft News’ editorial team use the words “diverse, credible and well-rounded” to describe the content they look to promote. Diversity is important to the Microsoft News team, who carefully compose the app’s pages daily to include multiple sides to a story and believe considered opinion pieces help a user to better understand a story.  </span></p>

    <flatplan:template identifier="default"/>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s fair to say there’s quite a lot of buzz around <a href="http://mth.me/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a>. Preloaded onto all modern Apple devices, Apple News is becoming a vital platform for many publishers, but as integration hasn’t been easy to achieve in the past, some publishers have held back from capitalising on this huge new audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the developers behind FlatPlan we’ve made integration onto the platform as easy as supplying a link to your website, and as we spend every waking moment working with Apple News we thought we’d round up a number of the key reasons you should embrace the platform…</span></p>
<h2><b>1. The way Apple News delivers content opens up completely new audiences</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open an iPhone, iPad or modern Apple computer and you’re likely to find Apple News preloaded onto the home screen. Some 90 million people are active on the platform each month and its prominence, user experience and clever use of notifications make it the primary news and content source for many.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of key things differentiate Apple News audiences from those of, say, Facebook, Google or Instagram: the intent of the audience, and the way content is surfaced to that audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s great about this audience is their intent. Where your stories compete against a myriad of images and posts from friends on Facebook or Instagram, users in Apple News are there to read news, or medium to long-form content. This leads to strong average active reading times and makes it a great platform for building loyalty from readers. But it’s how Apple News gets you in front of these audiences that really differentiates it from search or social… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News suggests content by combining human curation with an algorithm. Users can follow publications or interests but where Apple News stands out is how it follows user interests and suggests content from all manner of publications on both the main category pages and articles pages, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say you run a digital publication that covers movies. There’s every chance an article you write about James McAvoy could be featured using Apple’s human curation, or shown to people with an interest in movies, an interest in films that James McAvoy starred in, an interest in similar actors or any number of similar tastes built up in Apple’s algorithm. Apple uses anonymised data through search and internet browsing too, so after a short time the app suggests a very good quality of content to users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key traffic driver is Apple’s algorithm-controlled “recirculation area” below articles. Thanks to this algorithm there’s every possibility that your content could sit directly below a story from an internationally-renowned publisher with a serious readership. For example, here’s a story from the small online football publication Club Call under a BBC piece selected by Apple’s editors as a Top Story:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75758" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Club-Call-story-below-BBC-story-in-Apple-News-1.png" alt="Club Call story below BBC story in Apple News" width="678" height="730" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Club-Call-story-below-BBC-story-in-Apple-News-1.png 728w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Club-Call-story-below-BBC-story-in-Apple-News-1-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to read more about how Apple News surfaces content? </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/apple-news-humans-algorithms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a deep dive into the app from the New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>2. You can run your own advertising on the platform, or allow Apple to monetise your publication for you</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a common misconception that publishers aren’t able to run advertising on Apple News. In fact, the platform allows advertising across the homepage, category pages and all article pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads can be trafficked through Apple’s Workbench system, but it’s likely you use Google Ad Manager (formerly Doubleclick for Publishers) – Apple now allow you to traffic ads through your existing system if that’s what you use. 100% of revenue from your direct campaigns go straight to the publisher (Apple has no involvement in these deals), but Apple offer two additional revenue opportunities from inventory they sell: </span></p>
<p><b>Backfill</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Apple sell campaigns for backfill, with publishers receiving 70% of the revenue</span></p>
<p><b>Pooled</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Publishers earn revenue from ads that appear in between their stories in areas of the app they don’t control, such as the Today feed or in topic areas such as Fashion or Technology. Publishers share 50% of this revenue, allocated based on time spent with each channel’s articles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native campaigns can be served into Apple News as well. These can be delivered as part of your standard publishing workflow – your team just need to tick a button to send them to Apple News when they hit publish in their CMS. </span><a href="https://apple.news/A5-yIpCFdRJCZYnwytx-dFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s an example from the Telegraph – this story appears in the app the same way as a standard story, but with a native flag shown in listings and on the article.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75759" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-native-story-example-in-The-Telegraphs-channel.png" alt="Apple News native story example in The Telegraph's channel" width="678" height="328" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-native-story-example-in-The-Telegraphs-channel.png 654w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Apple-News-native-story-example-in-The-Telegraphs-channel-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can direct further traffic to native campaigns with Apple’s Native units. By putting some of your client’s spend into Apple News you can direct Apple’s audience to their stories, tapping into a largely affluent audience with strong intent, in a brand-safe space. Here’s an example of native ads hosted within the app:</span></p>
<h2><b><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75948" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-native-story-in-The-Telegraphs-Apple-News-channel-1.png" alt="A native story in The Telegraph's Apple News channel" width="678" height="425" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-native-story-in-The-Telegraphs-Apple-News-channel-1.png 1028w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-native-story-in-The-Telegraphs-Apple-News-channel-1-300x188.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-native-story-in-The-Telegraphs-Apple-News-channel-1-768x481.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-native-story-in-The-Telegraphs-Apple-News-channel-1-1024x641.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></b></h2>
<h2><b>3. This new audience can help you spot opportunities on other platforms</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News is now available on around 1.4 billion devices around the world, and according to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, some 5 billion articles are read on the app each month. As traffic continues to grow it’s clear that a solid audience is available in the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News data is not available within Google Analytics, but within a dashboard of its own, with stats sent optionally by email to team members daily, weekly or monthly.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75761" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75761" style="width: 880px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75761" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Graph-illustrating-Apple-News-growth-1024x499.png" alt="Graph illustrating Apple News growth" width="880" height="429" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Graph-illustrating-Apple-News-growth-1024x499.png 1024w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Graph-illustrating-Apple-News-growth-300x146.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Graph-illustrating-Apple-News-growth-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75761" class="wp-caption-text">How Shares, Likes and Saves within one of our Apple News channels have been increasing since their integration</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New streams of traffic are, of course, always welcome, but how you dig into this data can offer valuable insight into your content on other channels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s algorithms can expose stories to readers that haven’t performed well on a publisher website or on socials. By monitoring user behaviour when users visit an article Apple can give more reach to the most compelling content, driving spikes of traffic to stories that might have gone unnoticed elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping an eye on these stories open up opportunity to re-try seeding them on-site and on socials – tweaking headlines, images or placements to drive traffic to articles, mirroring the effect from Apple News.</span></p>
<h2><b>4. Your Apple News channel can drive growth for the rest of the business</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most publishers rely on multiple revenue streams to drive the business with each individual channel working to aid others as much as possible. If approached correctly, Apple News can work to drive value outside of the app, aiding everything from data capture to events to paywall subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at FlatPlan we bring all manner of publications to Apple News – from fast-moving consumer news publications to titles that operate on freemium models, to B2B industry magazines. Each publication has a set of goals we work to – many of which revolve around building loyal audiences and monetising those audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer guidance on how to use Apple News to achieve those goals and tools to help you get there. Here are a couple of examples. Dazed, a consumer style publication wanted to drive Apple News readers to their mailing list. FlatPlan allows them to promote this under every article.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75762" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Creative-Reviews-custom-Apple-News-footer.png" alt="Creative Review's custom Apple News footer" width="678" height="727" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Creative-Reviews-custom-Apple-News-footer.png 731w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Creative-Reviews-custom-Apple-News-footer-280x300.png 280w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, </span><a href="https://www.90min.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90Min</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> direct traffic to their main site:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75763" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/90Min-magazines-custom-Apple-News-footer.png" alt="90Min magazine's custom Apple News footer" width="678" height="728" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/90Min-magazines-custom-Apple-News-footer.png 729w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/90Min-magazines-custom-Apple-News-footer-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers can of course link within Apple News articles to external pages they want their audience to see. For instance, </span><a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> often link out to RSVP links for the regular events they host.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By creating great content and following our guidance, publishers are able to develop an audience in Apple News and then use tools like FlatPlan’s custom footers to derive value from that audience.</span></p>
<h2><b>5. You can automate delivery, opening up this new audience without slowing down your team</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating with Apple News used to be a complicated process. Publishers would need to build a bespoke system of their own to handle the induction, and they’d need to take care of their own error reporting. FlatPlan takes care of all this heavy-lifting, handling collection, conversion and delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With FlatPlan, feeding content to Apple News is as simple as clicking publish within a CMS. All we require is an RSS feed; a simple output that most CMSs contain by default. We even take care of categorising content and delivering stories to Apple News with an elegant flourish that matches brand designs to a tee. All publishers need to do is what they do best: write and design clear, beautiful digital stories.</span></p>

    <flatplan:template identifier="default"/>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its 2018 Q2 earnings announcement, Facebook indicated that their revenue growth could reduce significantly if users continue the trend for focussing the majority of their viewing time on Stories, as opposed to the News Feed. Its share price dropped 20%, destroying $120 billion in the company’s value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Facebook and Messenger Stories are currently only used by 300 million people a day. An obscenely large number, yet less than 10% of Facebook’s user base. Compared to Instagram, 40% of whose users interact with Stories every day, it’s a relatively insignificant bracket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, Facebook is eager to preempt what’s beginning to look like a shift to Stories. So, the company has begun to experiment with a new carousel-style layout for the News Feed, that would behave in exactly the same way as Stories. The experiment also merges Feeds and Stories into the same stream. Frequent </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contributor and reverse engineering expert </span><a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Manchun Wong</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spotted the prototype for this new Feed in the Android version of Facebook, and screen-captured her findings:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Facebook is testing to turn News Feed into Story Feed <a href="https://t.co/83H7VWcgmD">pic.twitter.com/83H7VWcgmD</a></p>
<p>— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1117749628340826112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, in this prototype, when a News Feed post’s header or surrounding space is tapped, users see a full-screen version of the post. From there, they can swipe left to reveal the next piece of content in the carousel, which may be one of four things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional News Feed posts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">News Feed ads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vertical Stories</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vertical Stories ads</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite swiping to keep the carousel rotating, users are still able to Like, react or comment on Feed posts while in this interface.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75730" style="width: 485px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75730 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Facebook-Hybrid-News-Feed-Stories-Carousel.jpg" alt="Facebook's hybrid News Feed/Stories carousel" width="485" height="680" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Facebook-Hybrid-News-Feed-Stories-Carousel.jpg 485w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Facebook-Hybrid-News-Feed-Stories-Carousel-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75730" class="wp-caption-text">Facebook’s hybrid News Feed/Stories carousel</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Facebook’s News Feed engagement is in an overall state of decline – </span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-shows-facebook-usage-dropped-for-a-second-straight-year-in-the-u/550019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many reports suggest it is</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – and Stories engagement is growing, then it’s implied that users are losing interest in the main News Feed and looking elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/facebook-hybrid-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed to TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it’s actively experimenting with this hybrid News Feed/Stories approach, but also noted that it’s still in the very early stages of development.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch that “We are currently not testing this publicly” as the company must still complete the user research phase before any public experimentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the importance of Facebook’s News Feed slowly declines, Stories presents the most pressing area of engagement for publishers that use Facebook. To connect these two areas is to connect the area users are beginning to spend the majority of their time in with the area that, for now, is driving Facebook’s revenue. A canny move on the company’s part, and one it’s worth keeping an eye one.</span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp was built for private chatting not public sharing, so using it to share news with users presents a unique set of challenges for publishers. But, a group of publishers have started to undertake WhatsApp marketing strategies to explore what’s possible with the service. A western brand may call this a necessity but still feel distanced from it. But in India, WhatsApp’s most populous market, the narrative of news consumption has unfolded to make a transition to WhatsApp not a calculation, but a natural next step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a widely-held estimate that in January 2018, Indian WhatsApp user numbers reached 300 million. It may well be even higher than this today. Remarkable, considering WhatsApp has 1.6 billion monthly users internationally. Check the rapid increase in growth rate for Indian WhatsApp users:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75705" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75705" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IndianWhatsAppUserGrowth-1024x875.png" alt="Indian WhatsApp User Growth" width="450" height="385" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IndianWhatsAppUserGrowth-1024x875.png 1024w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IndianWhatsAppUserGrowth-300x256.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IndianWhatsAppUserGrowth-768x657.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75705" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: http://www.businessofapps.com/data/whatsapp-statistics/</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-reported statistics reveal that 82% of Indian internet users are on the app, putting it behind Facebook (89%) and YouTube (93%) only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany’s another area of significant interest. According to <a href="https://www.axelspringer.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axel Springer</a>’s Hannah Schwär: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">94% of young Germans favour [WhatsApp] over other social media apps. Especially in times where it’s really hard to reach a young audience via news apps or Facebook, this is a really interesting channel.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the run up to the 2018 German federal elections, Axel Springer attempted to devise a way to engage young voters. Their in-house team created <a href="http://shotty.news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shotty</a>. </span></p>
<h2><b>What’s Shotty?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of its catchy name, Shotty is not actually a chatbot. Schwär found that commercially available WhatsApp chatbots didn’t support voice messages, a feature key to Shotty. So yes, the team literally had to manage the community by hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shotty worked on the basis that the editor and host record a bulletin at 5am every morning with a loose, conversational tone. Then, they would distribute it via WhatsApp at 7am. Most users reported feeling too lazy to read much news in the early hours of the morning, so audio fitted into their morning routine seamlessly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Schwär told Medium that without a WhatsApp-supported technical infrastructure it’ll be difficult to scale Shotty up any further. <a href="https://www.scoopwhoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScoopWhoop</a> is a great example of WhatsApp-supported infrastructure deployed effectively, allowing for indefinite growth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013 by six friends from advertising and marketing backgrounds, ScoopWhoop is best considered as India’s answer to sites like <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Huffington Post</a>. Co-founder and CEO Sattvik Mishra told <a href="https://inc42.com/startups/scoopwhoop-growth-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc42</a> “We would go through all these sites in the US that had viral content such as <a href="http://diply.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diply.com</a> or Huffington Post or even a Buzzfeed. And we realised that this same culture was being replicated here in India.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All our publications around that time, apart from those in mainstream media, were American in nature, talking about their TV shows, their problems, and their issues. And the pop culture that did exist in India was US-focussed. So we decided to do something about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ScoopWhoop’s WhatsApp service merely requires a user to click a button and send the automatically added ScoopWhoop contact a message, and they will begin to receive daily news updates via WhatsApp. The service is automated using MessengerPeople (then known as WhatsBroadcast); an identical setup to I AM POP, which we’ve <a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/working-through-facebooks-pivot-to-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered in the past</a>. It works similarly to <a href="https://www.thequint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Quint</a>’s WhatsApp chatbot.</span></p>
<h2><b>What’s The Quint?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quint is an English and Hindi language news site founded by Raghav Bahl and Ritu Kapur. Initially, they used WhatsApp Business to distribute content with their readers. But the system restricted them to manually updating multiple 256-member WhatsApp groups, rather than one all-encompassing list. The response was overwhelming, and they quickly began to look into more efficient ways of distributing their content via WhatsApp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like ScoopWhoop, The Quint decided to experiment with <a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MessengerPeople</a>. Now, all a reader had to do was send the word ‘Start’ to the WhatsApp window, and they’d begin receiving daily news bulletins. Here’s how they look.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75706" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75706" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75706" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BloombergQuintMessengerPeople.png" alt="Bloomberg Quint's WhatsApp MessengerPeople Service" width="320" height="639" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BloombergQuintMessengerPeople.png 513w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BloombergQuintMessengerPeople-150x300.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75706" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: https://www.messengerpeople.com/chatbots-what-is-a-whatsapp-bot-actually/</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, The Quint tried MessengerPeople through the <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BloombergQuint</a> branch of the publication, as the content is niche; stock updates, business news, etc. The user base grew rapidly, leading many users to the site and increasing and driving monetisation. This particular WhatsApp service has over 268,000 subscribers as of August 2018. And that’s just BloombergQuint; The Quint hosts a number of other channels, such as <a href="https://www.thequint.com/neon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEON</a> and <a href="https://fit.thequint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FIT</a>.</span></p>
<h2><b>How is WhatsApp performing in the UK?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this hype isn’t restricted to India, of course. WhatsApp is performing brilliantly in the UK. Facebook and YouTube are the UK’s most popular social networks, both tied with 79% of social network users in the UK as of February 2018. WhatsApp, however, is the UK’s most popular chat app, with a social network user share of 58%. That tops even Facebook Messenger’s monthly active users. Here’s how the whole graph looks.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75707" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75707" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75707" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SocialNetworksRankedByUsageUK.png" alt="Social networks ranked by usage in the UK" width="600" height="446" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SocialNetworksRankedByUsageUK.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SocialNetworksRankedByUsageUK-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75707" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: https://www.messengerpeople.com/whatsapp-user-base-uk/</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>I’m convinced. How do I use MessengerPeople?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the ‘<a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/whatsapp-business-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Case</a>’ for users who would like to send notifications and alerts over WhatsApp. This is likely the area which digital publishers will be most interested in.</span></p>
<h3><i>Use</i><b><i> Case: Notifications & Alerts</i></b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use messaging apps to send your customers important information or updates in real-time, reaching them on their smartphone lock screen.</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><b>Verification</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – such as registration or login confirmation, two-factor authentication, etc.</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Confirmation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – for example, booking or payment confirmations.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Alert</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – delivery status, flight time changes and more.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Reminder</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – for an appointment or an unpaid bill, etc.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After signing up for the 14-day free trial, here’s what you need to do:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on ‘Configure Test Numbers’ in the WhatsApp Business Test Users panel in the dashboard to save the test user phone numbers (yours and your colleagues’).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you or another test user message to your channel number (which you can find in ‘WhatsApp Business Test Users’ in the Dashboard).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this is done, navigate to the ‘Assignment’ page and assign the received ticket to any agent. It can then be replied to via WhatsApp.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on how to get started with the service, head </span><a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/messenger-communication-platform/)"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing starts at €699 per month, with additional packages available according to the chat answers, agents and channels the user requires. The full price breakdown and comprehensive list of features can be found </span><a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/pricing/#1547715090799-2364e414-bbe3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s plenty of evidence that MessengerPeople is worthwhile for publishers. Mathematics spoke to International Marketing Manager Birgit Bucher, who told us:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span></i><a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/messenger-communication-platform/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messenger Communication Platform</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is based on personalized messenger customer communication. The customer contacts a business first in order to receive information and news. So naturally, there is an impressive opening rate behind that. Our clients have an average open rate of up to 90% and click-through rate of 35%.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most WhatsApp users also have the push-notification enabled, so the message appears directly and immediately on the lock screen. This ensures maximum awareness. With the help of our platform, companies were able to increase their customer satisfaction.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Our take</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, there are downsides to a WhatsApp strategy. As you’re no doubt aware, it’s not a ‘share-friendly’ platform, so requires a strategy entirely of its own, separate to that of social media channels. Also, the way that images download automatically onto users’ phones is a cumbersome frustration, occupying gallery space and potentially leading to unsubscribes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always good to be careful when using startups that piggyback services like WhatsApp, but since changing from WhatsBroadcast, MessengerPeople has been officially endorsed by WhatsApp. It is one of the few official WhatsApp Business API providers worldwide. See </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/solutions-explorer/messaging/316098905687002/MessengerPeople"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their official recognition. I asked Bucher for clarity here and she explained “…there is no risk of WhatsApp cutting any numbers of our clients. You can read more about the WhatsApp Business API </span><a href="https://www.messengerpeople.com/whatsapp-business-api-at-a-glance-features-potentials-and-costs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Mathematics, we believe the proliferation of WhatsApp presents an absolutely vital opportunity to publishers. As of the time of publishing, you have the chance to be among the first British publishers utilising the platform in this way. You should take it.</span></p>

    <flatplan:template identifier="default"/>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/vb.4/10107028374517921/?type=2&video_source=user_video_tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down with Matthias Döpfner – CEO of Axel Springer – for a discussion about the roles of Facebook and journalism in a bustling digital media industry. During their conversation, which took place in Berlin and was broadcast to the world via Facebook, Zuckerberg revealed that he was considering launching a dedicated tab within Facebook for news, which would feature “high-quality, trustworthy content”. It could potentially be introduced before the end of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zuckerberg estimates that 10-20% of Facebook’s audience would be interested in this new section. It will be free for all users, though Facebook may pay publishers whose work is featured in an effort to encourage responsible reporting. Currently, it’s not clear if Facebook would personally pay publishers or monetize this through an ad revenue share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this idea is evidence that Zuckerberg will aim to remain true to the </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/working-through-facebooks-pivot-to-privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promises made</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his recent </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding Facebook’s substantial privacy and transparency issues. Perhaps it’s a savvy play engineered to ensure Facebook can continue to compete with Google and </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/a-publishers-guide-to-apple-news-magazines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the news front. Don’t forget, Facebook has recently been confronted with new European Union </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/google-facebook-forced-to-pay-creators-under-new-eu-rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">copyright rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will require it to “compensate publishers and creators for the content that appears on their websites”. These plans could have come from a place of necessity, as opposed to genuine desire for an overhaul of practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook may hire editors to operate the news tab, but Zuckerberg told Döpfner that currently it’s unclear to what extent the content of the tab will be chosen by users or curated by editors. We do know that Facebook had to adapt its editorial strategy with trending news after being </span><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/facebook-gets-rid-of-its-human-editors-replaces-them-with-algorithms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of intentionally stifling conservative voices. Facebook was even </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-trending-news-leaked-documents-editor-guidelines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found by the Guardian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have given its editorial staff the ability to add or remove content from the trending bar, at their discretion. But, Zuckerberg went on to clarify: “We’re not going to have journalists making news. What we want to do is make sure that this is a product that can get people high-quality news.” All the same, Zuckerberg added: “I want to make sure that to the extent that we can that we’re funding as much high quality journalism as possible.” Döpfner replied, saying: “I’ve always been totally convinced that quality journalism in the digital world can only exist if there is also an element of paying readers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75685 size-large" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MarkZuckerbergAndMatthiasDöpfner-1024x561.png" alt="Mark Zuckerberg and Matthias Döpfner discuss Facebook's news tab" width="1024" height="561" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MarkZuckerbergAndMatthiasDöpfner-1024x561.png 1024w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MarkZuckerbergAndMatthiasDöpfner-300x164.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MarkZuckerbergAndMatthiasDöpfner-768x421.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MarkZuckerbergAndMatthiasDöpfner.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appeared that Zuckerberg wasn’t too proud to take a dig at some competition, either, claiming: “We’re coming to this from a very different perspective than some of the other players in the space who view news as a way that they want to maximise their revenue” – possibly a reference to <a href="http://mth.me/a-publishers-guide-to-apple-news-magazines/">Apple News+</a>, Apple’s recently unveiled ‘Netflix for news’ which came under fire when it was </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/13/media/apple-news-subscription/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it will take 50% of revenue from the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area Zuckerberg was keen to discuss was local news. Facebook’s late-2017 introduction of their ‘meaningful interactions’ algorithm saw the platform begin prioritising posts from friends and families of users. This meant that only news with the most emotionally stirring, click-driven headlines broke through to news feeds. It’s highly unusual for local stories to carry the weight of scoops on a national or international level. Facebook seems to be working to undo some damage the algorithm change brought with it; proof that the promises Zuckerberg makes in his essay on privacy may hold true? Furthermore, Zuckerberg expressed a desire to make small payments to third-party fact checkers and local news organisations.</span></p>
<h2><b>Our take</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Facebook changed its News Feed algorithm to prioritise ‘meaningful interactions’, the idea of users clicking to a tab to view news would have had us up in arms. Surely, to have to navigate to a separate tab is to massively compromise content impressions? Well, it depends. The user intent of a reader would potentially change, which could exchange large click volumes for fewer users – but potentially users of a higher value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this was the case, then hypothetically, Facebook could pay publishers according to dwell time, the same way Apple News+ does. This could make for an interesting steer away from low quality snackable content driven by clickbait headlines. For some publishers this would be great news, for others it could mean the introduction of controversial practice; articles stuffed with assets that aim to keep users stuck on a page, for instance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll keep a close eye on best practice for the model if it rolls out. To be on Facebook’s news payroll could be an invaluable asset for publishers of all sizes and in all areas.</span></p>

    <flatplan:template identifier="default"/>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we’ve enjoyed the unique pleasure of onboarding <a href="https://apple.news/TWsA134eJQGOGi-emyM58SA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Review</a> onto <a href="https://apple.news/TWsA134eJQGOGi-emyM58SA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple News</a>. Working closely with the team we strived to create an Apple News channel that communicates as well as its website and print publication, presenting journalism as graceful as the work it covers, presented in an equally tasteful fashion.</span></p>
<h2><b>What did Creative Review require?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Review occupies an unrivalled position within the creative industries. Alongside the print edition, which you’ll find on many a creatives’ desk, the digital publication operates inside a ‘freemium’ framework, where 50% of its content is behind a paywall, and the other 50% is available to anybody. This model launched last year with much success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Review doesn’t provide dry, industry-only reportage. The team cover everything from art, film and television advertising, publishing to illustration, with unparalleled levels of coverage. Being part of the creative industries isn’t a prerequisite to falling in love with its content. And, as their freemium model has proven, new readers who discover the publication will often convert into paying subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News offers a number of opportunities for a title like Creative Review. Apple’s algorithm works to learn a user’s interests and their UI surfaces stories of interest to that user. This allows a story from Creative Review to appear under a story from, say, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a>, or within a user’s personalised news feed, based either on context or personal taste. International users who may never have heard of Creative Review could end up spending plenty of time with their content, which made Apple News an enticing prospect for the team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Review is published by Centaur Media, and houses a lively, engaged editorial team and a busy development department who work across multiple publications. With that in mind, we had to make their induction into Apple News as smooth as possible and make day-to-day delivery just as straightforward, to avoid obstructing hectic schedules.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><em>As a magazine which writes about the creative industry, we have to be a bit finickity about things like the leading of type and how images sit on a page. I think all of us breathed a sigh of relief when we saw the draft templates designed by Mathematics…they got CR straight away. We think the final templates do full justice to the brilliant photography, film and design work we write about. What’s even better, is that publishing to Apple News on a daily basis hasn’t added to our work load!</em><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – Salonee Gadgil, Digital Content Producer, Creative Review.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that a publication that appeals to creatives had to be designed well. This is a team that notice and care about the exact spacing between an image and a caption, or the perfect line height on mobile, tablet and desktop. Total control over look and feel was core to the brief, as was paying attention to the finest details, to ensure brand integrity.</span></p>
<h2><b>How did we ensure Creative Review’s goals were met?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started out by listening to Creative Review’s overall goals and how Apple News could help meet them. From here we offered insights into how Apple News performs and how best to approach growth on the platform. Considering the publication’s freemium paywall model many of these conversations focused around strategies to connect with readers that are most likely to be interested in Creative Review, helping the team to seed specific pieces of content to build loyalty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique to <a href="http://mth.me/flatplan-apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlatPlan</a> is the ability for us to deliver beautiful “Apple News Format” pages through nothing more than an RSS feed. This meant the resource required from Centaur’s tech team was minimal, with the system now running without any need for their developers to maintain. All the editorial team have to do to introduce stories to Apple News is tick a box when publishing a story to their site. FlatPlan automatically maps content by category, so stories are automatically grouped into the relevant section within the Creative Review Apple News channel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working to Creative Review’s brand guidelines we designed pages to perfectly replicate the desired look and feel. We then built out pages to be effective across mobile, tablet and desktop. This guarantees that the work Creative Review covers lives up to its full potential, no matter the device. Here’s a desktop story:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75631" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-10.51.12.png" alt="Creative Review Apple News Desktop" width="450" height="480" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-10.51.12.png 729w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-10.51.12-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here’s a mobile story:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75635" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-577x1024.png" alt="Creative Review Apple News Mobile" width="450" height="799" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-577x1024.png 577w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1-169x300.png 169w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image1.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant part of allowing the publication’s work to proliferate further was the custom footer we built. It appears at the bottom of every article, and working to the publisher’s goals it drives newsletter signups and key socials. Its sleek yet bold call to actions are tailor-made to invite conversions. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75633" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-10.51.23.png" alt="Creative Review Apple News Footer" width="450" height="483" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-10.51.23.png 729w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-10.51.23-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlatPlan’s simplicity offered Creative Review a quick and easy turnaround on Apple News. Our knowledge of the platform helped Creative Review to launch onto Apple News with a strategy driven by insights and guidance on growth. It’s early days, but Creative Review has already seen huge success since launch, with articles featured in the Spotlight and chosen by Apple News editors within editorial groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75650" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cr.jpg" alt="Creative Review in Apple News' Editors' Picks" width="450" height="600" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cr.jpg 640w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cr-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></span></p>

    <flatplan:template identifier="default"/>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mark Zuckerberg’s recent lengthy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">essay</a>, the social media giant will ‘pivot to privacy’, putting this at the top of its list of priorities. Zuckerberg claims the Facebook of the future will be built on several principles: private interactions, encryption (specifically end-to-end encryption as found in WhatsApp so nobody, not even Facebook, can see what you share), reducing permanence, safety, interoperability (ease of communication across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, in this case) and secure data storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Zuckerberg fully intends Facebook to remain the social media platform of today and tomorrow. But it’s easy to be cynical about this announcement if you have a basic understanding of Facebook’s business model. Facebook’s ‘pivot to privacy’ is missing discussion on its underlying business model: Facebook is in the business of profiting off user data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t sell user data to third party marketers, but it profits off it. In order to truly change their ways, Facebook has some options, but none of them are good for it as a business. They can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally change their business model. Not a good option if you’re making $56 billion dollars a year from advertising.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can show provide more transparency and give users more controls. But how much transparency do you provide, and how do you do it? Because these are not easy issues to explain. A lot of the world still doesn’t care, but more and more users are interested, advocacy groups are interested, and regulators are very interested.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a quote from Sheryl Sandberg on transparency:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the problems with the business model is we’ve done a terrible job explaining it, and people don’t understand it. And when you don’t understand something, you can become very uncomfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Zuckerberg adds:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the vast majority of people would rather have an ad-supported platform for free than something they had to pay for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if these options aren’t great for business, then how can we be sure Zuckerberg will keep his promise? Particularly when trust in his company is dangerously low following the Cambridge Analytica scandal? At the very least, Zuckerberg isn’t naive about this. In his statement, “frankly we don’t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services,” is one among a few sheepish acknowledgements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is that, put simply, Facebook now intends to focus on profiting from messaging. </span></p>
<h2><b>What does this all mean for publishers?</b></h2>
<p>Moving (further) away from the news feed sounds daunting, but you’re far from the first to wonder how to make this work for you. Let’s talk about <a href="https://www.iampop.com/">I AM POP</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll notice their tagline is “Reach your audience directly on messaging apps”. It’s succinct, and that really is all there is to it. Your audience can receive a message sent en-masse as though it were a friend saying hi.</p>
<p>You can even create an ‘interactive narrative’ – a feature I Am Pop boldly calls “a whole new medium for storytelling”. Boasting an average open rate of 94%, I Am Pop looks like a seriously inviting proposition for publishers, whose social news feeds are crowded, with algorithms filtering out 98% of updates.</p>
<p><a href="https://crackmagazine.net/">Crack Magazine</a> use the platform very effectively. Every Monday morning, they send ‘AM:DM’ – a collection of five music recommendations. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-75622 aligncenter" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PeachPivotToPrivacy-245x300.png" alt="Crack Magazine Pivot To Privacy" width="245" height="300" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PeachPivotToPrivacy-245x300.png 245w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/PeachPivotToPrivacy.png 287w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louise Brailey, Crack’s Head of Film and Digital Editor, was happy to share some insights on the effectiveness of the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we were fleshing out the concept AM:DM, we were keen that it wouldn’t become a feed for our own content – we already have a weekly mailer which performs this function. Instead, we saw AM:DM as a chance to experiment with something a little fresher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Essentially, our editorial team uses it as an opportunity to share music direct to our subscribers’ inboxes, first thing on a Monday morning, that will set them up for the week ahead. This could be an overlooked album from the past, an obscure DJ mix that fell between the cracks, a DIY release on Bandcamp that deserves a broader audience, whatever. Sure, this means sacrificing traffic to other websites, but for us, it’s a chance to flex our curatorial muscle and expand Crack Magazine’s editorial purview – we feel this is just as valuable, if not more so, than driving traffic to the site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hovering around a 90% open rate, and we’re gaining new followers each week, so we’ve struck a chord.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent feature on </span><a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/messenger-bot-startup-i-am-pop-raises-e2m-as-bmg-mad-decent-join-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music Business Worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I AM POP founder Tim Heineke said: “We are entering an era of post-social. Private messaging is the new social network. Users are increasingly flocking to DM, private chat, groups and stories, fuelled by privacy concerns.” Head of Growth Max van den Ingh added: I AM POP is championing the shift from newsfeed sharing to direct messaging in the music industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s absolutely no reason to suggest I AM POP should remain a privilege exclusive to those in the music industry.</span></p>
<h3><b>So how can I set up I AM POP?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before messaging your audience using I AM POP, you need them to subscribe to you on Messenger. Once you’ve connected Messenger to I AM POP via your Facebook page, you’ll see your dedicated Messenger link; it starts with ‘m.me/’. When your audience follow this link, they’ll be instructed to click the ‘Get Started’ button. After that, they’re subscribed.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do I grow my subscriber list?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest step to take is put your m.me link in your social bios, inviting people to subscribe for exclusive content, or material that your publication doesn’t otherwise provide. I AM POP suggest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating a custom Facebook cover photo too. Here’s an example from Australian musician Tash Sultana:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75623 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TashSultanaPivotToPrivacy.jpg" alt="Tash Sultana Pivot To Privacy" width="828" height="315" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TashSultanaPivotToPrivacy.jpg 828w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TashSultanaPivotToPrivacy-300x114.jpg 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TashSultanaPivotToPrivacy-768x292.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to engage fans in the specific way Tash has – by getting them to message you something for a specific automated response – follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Go to your I AM POP Dashboard </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Go to “Automated” </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Click on “Replies” You should be seeing the following: “Create replies to fan messages. A fan sends a message, the bot responds.” </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Click on the “+” </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get creative</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an I AM POP user, you can head to the </span><a href="https://www.iampop.com/dashboard/grow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section of their site to retrieve an embed code you can use to add a ‘Message Us’ button to your own site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, it’s totally up to you to engage people however you like. Don’t rule out creating a specific post or video post announcing your new service and encouraging people to subscribe. </span></p>
<h3><b>How can I optimise my Facebook page for maximum Messenger growth?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On your Facebook page, go to “Settings > Messaging > General settings” and enable “Prompt visitors to send messages”. With this switched on, the chat will be open automatically when somebody visits the page on desktop, helping convert that traffic into Messenger subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can submit the Messenger bot to Facebook to be included on their Messenger Discover tab, “where people can browse and find Messenger bots, nearby places and businesses to message”. </span><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/discovery/discover-tab"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s more information on it. There’s a lot of submissions so not everyone can be featured, but </span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/26/how-to-get-your-bot-featured-in-the-facebook-messenger-discover-tab/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s an article that’ll help you maximise your chances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget, you’re able to customise the CTA on your Facebook page’s ‘Send message’ button. We’d encourage you to experiment with this, and search for the magic formula that really helps you to drive I AM POP subscribers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Doesn’t I AM POP have any competition?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course! Namely, from </span><a href="https://chatfuel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatfuel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is currently the most popular Messenger bot available. Its list of clients features some of the largest companies on the planet. It’s also not going to cost you as much money as I AM POP. For these reasons, it remains a go-to for brands looking to explore chatbots for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatfuel doesn’t come without its drawbacks: without coding skills, you won’t be able to see the conversations that have taken place inside Chatfuel. Also, when you link out to a separate webpage, there’s no data available to tell you whether the link was clicked or not. This would need to be tracked with a tool like <a href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most important, perhaps, is I AM POP’s extensive functionality. They provide a more intuitive interface and dashboard than Chatfuel, simple statistics functions and audience segmentation tools, and the potential for creativity with their various chat templates. You can even create your own. As such, we’d recommend I AM POP for professionals in creative industries; it’s a platform well-suited to digital publishers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be impartial, it’s a fascinating time for social media. Facebook’s recent controversies combined with its potential merging of Instagram and WhatsApp messaging puts significant emphasis on the possibilities of profiting from dark social, which, naturally, will become an area of primary focus. As such, Messenger could evolve as fast as Facebook’s news feed, particularly as it increases its capacity to share with WhatsApp and Instagram. All this means that the potential of what chatbots are capable of should expand dramatically in the coming years. As such, we’d recommend getting started now to stay ahead of the digital publishing competition. </span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, 25th of March, 2019, Apple gathered the press and figures of highest influence in tech to its California headquarters for some significant announcements. The headline acts of the evening for publishers? A new territory for News – Canada – and the introduction of magazines to Apple News. Say hello to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-news/">Apple News+</a>.</p>
<p>Now live in the US and Canada, Apple has launched with 320 magazines and newspapers including Time, Vogue, People, National Geographic, Billboard, The LA Times and Wall Street Journal. Following a one month trial, access to all titles will cost $9.99 US and $12.99 in Canada.</p>
<h2>So what does Apple News+ mean for publishers?</h2>
<p>First of all, full disclosure. We’re the team behind <a href="http://mth.me/flatplan-apple-news/">FlatPlan</a> – the system that allows publishers to get onto Apple News with any CMS – and we were delivering content to Apple News+ Canada from launch – so you could certainly say we’re fans of Apple News. But we’re a business that’s powered by publishers, so we have a good understanding of both the platform and the implications for the industry. Here’s all the information you need from the announcement.</p>
<h3>What’s changed?</h3>
<p>Open the new app and you won’t immediately notice a difference to the UI. The free tier in Apple News still takes centre stage, offering curated and algorithm driven news and content recommendations. Magazines appear within the app, neatly flowing into the Today feed. Publishers are given “New issue” and “Featured issue” screen estate to showcase covers, chosen for readers based on their interests and from Apple News editors’ curation.</p>
<p>“Live covers” allow publications to create moving versions of their covers, using motion to leverage their storytelling capabilities and entice readers to click through. <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The reader that wishes to dive into the magazine is led into a contents page and can view articles in Apple News Format – Apple’s own format that that allows pages to be presented in beautiful, screen-optimised pages with animations, behaviours and custom styles to bring an immersive experience.</span></p>
<h3>Apple News Format?</h3>
<p>It’s Apple News Format that sets Apple News+ apart from competitors that offer PDFs which require users to zoom in and out of pages that were destined for the printed page – not designed to be legible in screen. Publishers that make the most of this format will benefit most from Apple’s revenue model, as they’ll offer an experience that builds loyalty and increases dwell time.</p>
<h3>So what is the revenue model?</h3>
<p>Apple takes 50% of all revenue from Apple News+ subscriptions, with the rest of the revenue going into a pool to be divided between publishers. Revenues are dished out to publications based on the amount of time users spend engaged with articles – dwell time, basically. This gauge for payment isn’t perfect – visually-led articles will rarely attract the same dwell time as long-reads, and weekly publications will arguably have more opportunity to rack up views, but the simple fact is that the more compelling the publication the more revenue the publisher will receive.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how publishers react to this new model. We could see a shift to longer versions of articles delivered into Apple News+, or specially produced Apple News+ articles with behind the scenes video and extra photography. The smart publishers will use Apple News Format to go much further than just presenting stories, working with Apple News editors to showcase stories that make full use of the system. We find our FlatPlan ‘Feature’ stories that make full use of Apple News Format offer very high dwell times on Apple News at present – using the format to compel readers and increase revenues is key to success in Apple News+. One thing’s for sure – by focusing on dwell time over pageviews Apple will counteract clickbait – the aim of the game is to keep readers engaged.</p>
<h3>Is this damaging to news brands?</h3>
<p>Different publishers have different takes on this. Condé Nast, Hearst and Meredith have jumped feet-first into the new offering. Wall Street Journal’s approach has been to use Apple News to build new subscriber bases. New York Times aren’t posting to the paid tier at present, but still seeding content on Apple News+ free tier.</p>
<p>What’s clear is that consumer behavior is changing. Netflix has changed how people watch television. Gone are the days of following a schedule – people are now getting used to a world where they control what they consume and when they consume it. Apple News+ is at attractive proposition to the consumer, so while it won’t be right for every publication it’s going to be hard to ignore its impact.</p>
<h3>Do we need to share everything?</h3>
<p>You don’t. Wall Street Journal is delivering a ‘curated’ selection of stories to the platform. WSJ editor Matt Murray will dictate the stories that make it into the app but William Lewis, publisher of The Journal suggesting that the selection will be a mix of general, political and sports stories, based on stories that do well on the free tier of the platform at present.</p>
<h3>How much money could publishers make?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is hard to predict so early on, but assuming that 2% of the 90 million monthly users of Apple News will subscribe (1.8 million), with 320 titles currently available. If a title was to receive a 1/320 of total dwell time, they could each expect to receive around $28,097 per month.</span></p>
<p>Assuming the distribution of dwell time were to follow the 80/20 rule, we would expect the top publications to receive roughly $112,387 per month, whilst the majority (80%) might expect to receive around $7,024 per month.</p>
<h3>How big could it be?</h3>
<p>Apple has a huge user base – 1.4 billion active devices as of January this year. Apple Music has over 50 million paid subscribers, thanks to Apple’s promotional clout. The app will come preloaded with a free trial on all iPhones, iPads and computers, and features push notifications to drive users into the platform. 90 million people use the free tier of Apple News+, racking up 5 billion pageviews every month, so expect this launch to make an impact.</p>
<h3>What does the launch in Canada entail?</h3>
<p>Canada is Apple’s fourth territory (after the US, UK and Australia). What’s unique about this territory is the addition of a new language – French Canadian. We’re now delivering content for 90Min into both English speaking and French speaking channels. Apple plans to roll the app out into Europe soon, so we’ll see more language support soon.</p>
<h3>How do we get onto Apple News+?</h3>
<p>Apple News+ magazines is available to publications by invitation at present. <a href="mailto:info@wearemathematics.co.uk">Drop us a message</a> if you’d like to talk about how FlatPlan can help your bring your publication into the system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsible news is how I refer to the group of organisations striving to un-bias news consumption in an age defined by political polarity and an apparent unwillingness to engage in constructive, structured dialogue with opposing parties. You’ve seen this too, everywhere from Twitter to the most high-profile news on the planet. To provide news in this way is irresponsible. Yet, in a political climate as turbulent as ours, adapting practice is hardly a priority for much of top-tier journalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may come as a relief that there is a group of news organisations striving to simplify access to quality reporting, by aggregating that of our most reliable sources or by creating their own. These organisations value quality over quantity, in both quality news and quality time spent with their platform. In this piece, we focus on three organisations: Tortoise, Kinzen and Curio. Their subversion of traditional models makes our access to world-class reporting simpler than ever. Each could fit into our lives in a totally seamless way. </span></p>
<h2><b>Tortoise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Harding, the former Director of BBC News who co-founded <a href="https://www.tortoisemedia.com/">Tortoise</a>, coined the term ‘slow news’. It refers to an observation he has made lately in his decorated career: that the stories which took the longest to complete were consistently those that bore the most significant impact. “It was a lesson that said, actually, when you take the time, you can do journalism that is really valued and valuable – so that was the thinking [behind Tortoise Media],” </span><a href="https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/tortoise-editor-james-harding-says-move-to-slow-news-follows-lesson-at-times-and-bbc-that-journalism-that-took-longer-had-real-impact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he told Press Gazette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-75265 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TortoiseMedia.png" alt="Tortoise Media Responsible Journalism" width="1552" height="873" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TortoiseMedia.png 1552w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TortoiseMedia-300x169.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TortoiseMedia-768x432.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TortoiseMedia-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we need to clarify that as Amol Rajan of the BBC correctly </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45875284"><span style="font-weight: 400;">points out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “slow news has been around for years. It’s called the ‘Features’ section”. You know that, so you’re right to wonder why we need platforms like Tortoise: the labour of love belonging to Harding and Katie Venneck-Smith (former President of Wall Street Journal). Tortoise members contribute directly to the editorial process thanks to what Hardy calls a ‘system of organised listening’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise’s ‘Daily Edition’ – the daily AM news bulletin – won’t be a digest of top stories of the day. Instead, it will go in depth on five – possibly under-reported – stories. Tortoise hosts a daily “ThinkIn” from 6:00pm-7:40pm, encouraging attendees not to just ask questions, but to share strong opinions. It is broadcast live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tackle the ‘echo chamber’ effect, Tortoise plans to eventually take its ThinkIns on the road to prisons, clubs and schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise will be “non-party-political” with “no proprietor” and no “subtle relationships with advertisers”. Harding wants to shift from the focus on “liberty and fairness” of news organisations of the past. “Dignity – the idea that everyone has a right to be recognised and respected”, is his priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this output will focus on five broad areas: technology, finance, natural resources, identity and longevity. </span></p>
<p><b>Staff</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 20 top staffers full-time already, Tortoise hopes to employ over 40 permanent staffers by mid-2019. 10 editors will get a budget to bring in contributors, and Tortoise’s staff team of reporters and researchers will handle a significant portion of the original journalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise has disavowed breaking news but will still aim to break the type of stories that will be covered elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><b>Business Model</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise’s business model is all about membership – a “high-quality, low volume” business. Harding “doesn’t believe in native content” and he doesn’t want Tortoise to “become an ad agency”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue is also driven by commercial partnerships with big institutions, for whom Tortoise will organise on-site ThinkIns, which resemble the TED Talks model. The aim is to strike up 8 to 10 such partnerships with industry leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise is currently in beta phase – it’s unclear if a free trial version will be available once the platform launches properly. We don’t know when exactly that will be, but Tortoise’s offer of a discount for founding members ends on March 31st, implying a launch soon after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help outline the myriad merits of the platform, we spoke to Liz Moseley, Tortoise’s Members Editor. Consider this an outline of what the app aims to achieve, and how that distances it from the news pack. </span></p>
<p><b>Mathematics: Can you elaborate on what James means exactly when he refers to a “system of organised listening” – that is, how precisely users contribute to the editorial process?</b></p>
<p><strong>Liz Moseley, Members Editor: </strong><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When somebody joins Tortoise, they become a member of the newsroom, which means that they are active contributors to what we do. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My job, which I think is unique in news media, is a case in point. I’m an Editor, I’m in the daily conference, the long term planning conversations, and my sole focus is to act as the conduit between the members and the journalistic effort. So, I find people in the member base who can develop stories with us, and we gather their feedback. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment the main channel in the product for this is the ThinkIn. We host them four times a week at the moment, usually (not always) in the newsroom itself. So members come in around 5pm, when we’re still at work, and we have a conversation. In the course of that conversation – sometimes on a predetermined topic, sometimes on the news of the day – we will form a point of view. Informed by what people say.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequently, members raise questions that warrant follow up journalistically, so we write pieces that come directly off the back of what’s been said. We use footage from the Thinkins within the stories, it’s important the members can see themselves in the process and the work itself. We use our members as fact checkers, and actually as our conscience too. One of the first features we built in the beta app was “WDyT” which stands for “what do you think”. We’ve been bowled over by the amount of and quality of input we’ve had. I’ve worked in media for 20 years and I’ve never seen anything like it. Members are incredibly committed to it – they won’t let us rest on our laurels for a second.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Does Tortoise’s membership fee risk fostering coverage of stories that only affects a certain bracket of the population?</b><b></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full suite of pricing isn’t live yet. At the moment it’s £50 for three years for u30s, and the same if you get a gang together as join as a group of 10 or more. That’s pretty good value. We’ll be rolling our student pricing, pricing for social enterprises and so on as we build out. So we are being very deliberate about making sure Tortoise is accessible. The diversity of the member base is crucial to the success of the whole thing.<br />

<p><b>How will Tortoise strive to keep access to its services democratic?</b><b></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our home is in central London and it would be easy, or at least easier, for us to create an experience that is London-bound. Inviting people into the newsroom is one thing, but when we take Tortoise on the road and host ThinkIns in other places – even those that are still in London strangely – the conversations we have change. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those people who can’t make it to us, we’re bringing the Tortoise to you. So, for example, we hosted a ThinkIn in a school that is particularly affected by knife crime. This week we did a ThinkIn in a church. We’re going to a care home in Norwich. We have events coming up in Oxford, Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol. In the next couple of months we’re having ThinkIns in Amsterdam and New York. They’ll all be livestreamed. </span></i><i></i></p>
<p><b>The decision for a new company to host a conference (the ThinkIn) every day is a bold one. What measures will you take to keep this up in spite of how busy we can all be, or how tired after a hard day at work?</b><b></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strangely, we’re more worried about scaling it up than keeping it up. We want to be able to host ThinkIns wherever the members are. At the moment, demand is high and the quality is getting better all the time as we learn more about how to bring people into the conversation. When it comes to 5pm and we start to welcome people in (we’re all still working when the members arrive), it doesn’t feel like an effort, it’s exciting. Because it’s different every time. There’s a buzz about it. </span></i><i></i></p>
<p><b>Do you view Tortoise as a competitor to other, more established newsrooms, or as a complementary service?</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment it is complementary. People will always want their breaking news and they can’t get that from us. Quite a lot of our founding members are self-professed news junkies. They’re building the Tortoise habit at the moment, and we are starting to hear that some of them are easing off some of their previous news sources now they’re enjoying Tortoise. But that’s not what the business model is based on. It’s not an instead, it’s an alternative.</span></i></p>
<h2><b>Kinzen</b></h2>
<p><img class="wp-image-75266" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kinzen.png" alt="Kinzen Responsible Journalism" width="1552" height="836" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kinzen.png 1300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kinzen-300x162.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kinzen-768x414.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kinzen-1024x551.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Tortoise, <a href="https://kinzen.com/">Kinzen</a> is a news aggregator, as opposed to a newsroom in its own right. Kinzen utilises machine learning to allow a user to take control of their news consumption routine. That’s what they see, when they see it, how much of it they see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen hope to “make users empowered, giving you the ability to construct some form of filter and ranking system that reflects your intentions and not your instincts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can respond positively or negatively to news they’re provided with in Kinzen’s different topic channels. These are what’s analysed to present users with news they want. But you can also integrate your Twitter feed, where Kinzen’s algorithm will watch topics you follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is still in the testing phase, so Little and his team are building a pre-launch community over the next two months, inviting people to test pre-release versions of the iOS app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen currently has two long term goals, not outlined in detail as of yet: to reward valuable curators in the community, and to interest news organisations, presumably into partnership of some kind.</span></p>
<p><b>Business model</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen launched in January on a £5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subscription basis. Before launch, they were seeking donations in exchange for six months of access to Kinzen’s subscription services after launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to better understand Kinzen on a conceptual level and situate it clearly in the responsible news landscape, we reached out to CEO and co-founder Mark Little.</span></p>
<p><b>What type of content are Kinzen actively looking for, and what publications are you looking to court?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen’s mission is to connect the active news seekers of the world with the sources who reward their trust and attention. In other words, to build a user experience of news worth paying for. Our perfect partner is a publisher who wants to build deeper personal engagement with members of the communities they serve.  </span></i></p>
<p><b>How does Kinzen benefit publishers? </b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen is purpose-built for publishers who want to develop reader revenue products based on personalisation.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first product is a personal news app which offers users a highly curated experience of the open web. Initially, this drives traffic to publisher websites, and will soon become a sales pipeline for publishers offering subscription content. It will also help us perfect and refine Kinzen’s unique brand of ‘personalisation with a purpose’.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In parallel, Kinzen is developing a ‘white-label’ version of its user experience for partners. This technology solution will help publishers develop personalised newsletters and audio briefings, and can be eventually integrated into publisher apps and websites.</span></i></p>
<p><b>How can publishers monetise using Kinzen?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, publishers can use the Kinzen app as a lead generation tool for their reader revenue products (without sacrificing revenue or user relationships). Second, publishers can use Kinzen technology to build new reader revenue products or enhance existing ones.  </span></i></p>
<p><b>Do stories link directly to publishers à la Flipboard, or is all news viewed within the app?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All stories in the app link back to the publishers’ websites. All potential premium subscribers are directed to the publisher paywall/gate.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Technically speaking, how does a publisher get its content onto Kinzen? Do they provide an RSS feed, or is there more to it than that?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen’s data team can scrape, tag and organise content from any existing open website without any special relationship with the publishers. But RSS feeds will be core to any relationships based on reader revenue.</span></i></p>
<p><b>In an era when publishers are building loyalty and striving to retain valuable audiences of their own, why would you recommend a publisher work with Kinzen?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinzen’s founding team are old-school journalists who have worked for both traditional publishers and social platforms. We have a deep understanding of the problems facing publishers in a world dominated by big tech companies and aggregators. Kinzen doesn’t sell your ads, sell your content or ‘own’ your audience. We judge success by the value of the personal bond we help create between news seekers and publishers.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Users are encouraged to build their own channels, to explore what matters to them. How does Kinzen avoid turning each user’s experience into an echo chamber?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Kinzen’s founding goals is to help people see beyond the usual sources, and discover journalism they never knew existed.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not have an ad-funded business model. Our algorithms don’t need to fuel outrage and emotion. Kinzen does not track your browser history to keep you addicted to the same sources and opinions. We don’t rank news and information on the basis of what your social network is thinking.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, we have a Discovery section in the app which surfaces expertly curated sources and channels and an Emerging Topics feature which engineers serendipity based on editorial choices rather than popularity. Explicit user feedback and conscious choices drive our recommender systems.</span></i></p>
<h2><b>Curio</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75551" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Curio-300x72.jpg" alt="Curio Responsible Journalism" width="350" height="84" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Curio-300x72.jpg 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Curio.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://curio.onelink.me/PtA1/Mathematics">Curio</a> stands out in the lineup as it’s audio-led. There isn’t quite the same amount of information about Curio available online as Tortoise and Kinzen, but their site tells us that Curio creates “Intelligent Audio For Busy People”. It offers thousands of high-quality audio stories from the best publications in the world, no annoying ads, offline listening, all hand-picked by editors and read to the listener by award-winning narrators. What we know for certain is Curio’s sources are among the planet’s most reliable, including the Guardian, The Financial Times, The Economist and The Washington Post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, we wanted to be able to provide some concrete information explaining how the platform is of use to publishers. We were put in touch with Tain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">á Vilela, Curio’s Head of Brand, who helped make the service’s operations totally transparent. </span></p>
<p><b>How does Curio provide value for a user, from the perspective of the people working on it?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easier to discover great timeless stories with Curio, stories are often buried under a large volume of information. We are passionate about choosing content that is relevant to our lives and what goes on in the world. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our unrivalled collection of audio format stories, from some of the world’s most respected media outlets, gives people an opportunity to engage with great journalism on the go.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Does Curio view itself as a competitor to other ‘reading-led’ news apps such as Kinzen and Tortoise, or a complementary service?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio versus reading is not an “either or”. There are parts of our regular daily lives when screens are not ideal or easily accessible, like when we are commuting, cooking, performing chores around the house or before going to bed. That is when audio shines.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Who are your ‘award winning narrators’ and how are they selected?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of them are Audie Award winners who have worked for brands like National Geographic, BBC, Disney and others. They are trained actors and performers who are able to bring empathy, gravitas and life into any story.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Is an emphasis placed on individual publications within the app, or on your own curated playlists? In other words, are users encouraged to prioritise one over the other?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We help listeners find stories they love and publications to reach new audiences, increase engagement and create a new stream of revenue. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We uncover great ideas, well crafted pieces which can instigate interesting debate and personal growth. Good quality comes from established outlets like The Guardian, which was founded almost 200 years ago or AEON, a magazine around philosophy and culture which launched in 2012 and is still pretty much under the radar.</span></i></p>
<p><b>How will Curio ingest and consider user feedback?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Curio we are always listening. Our listeners are more than just “users” to us, they are stakeholders who trust us to provide them with the best content out there. Their feedback has a daily impact on our product, so we make sure to listen, learn and work on becoming better.</span></i></p>
<h2><b>Elsewhere in Responsible News</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, Jessica Lessin founded </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/"><b>The Information</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a subscription-based digital news organisation which Tortoise seemingly owes a lot to. The Information shares only a small handful of news stories per day. It earns 90% of its revenue from subscriptions, and an estimated 10,000 subscribers pay $399 per year for the service. It has been profitable for over two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 900,000-subscribers team at The Financial Times are interested in The Information’s strategy. They have reportedly discussed ways they could help to accelerate growth. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://agate.one/"><b>Agate</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is another startup that allows users to pay for individual articles as they go. It’s a digital wallet for which publishers can set their own pricing on a story-by-story basis. Agate aims to make it easier to consume premium content without blockage from an unaffordable paywall. But, in a crowded market of micropayment startups, they have a tough job ahead of them.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://spaceshipmedia.org/"><b>Spaceship Media</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t a platform, rather a form of consultancy that helps news organisations remain unbiased. They do this using ‘</span><a href="https://spaceshipmedia.org/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dialogue journalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ – a process developed by founders Eve Pearman and Jeremy Hay – to “[go] to the heart of social and political fractures” and “[build] journalism-supported conversations between regular people about the issues of deep consequence to all us”. Their belief is that establishing a journalism-supported dialogue between communities in conflict helps solve that conflict. In their words:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work with media organizations and others on several different levels. We design and manage engagement conversations from the ground up; we provide design and ongoing consulting support; we provide consulting around our engagement values and methodology and project visioning.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://vigilant.cc/"><b>Vigilant</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won the 2018 Startups for News contest at the General Editors Network conference. The platform offers ‘real time search and monitoring across thousands of public data sources’. This makes it easier for journalists to locate stories and angles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some ways, it’s a dark time for news journalism. You’re reading this because you know that the boundaries between truthful reporting and spin are blurrier than ever. Luckily, there is a vanguard of organisations whose functionality helps identify news brimming with bias. The purpose of this piece is not to depict one service in a more favourable light than another; we merely want to help you consume responsible news, and ensure your own journalistic output is consumed responsibly.</span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategies can be easily thrown off balance by the distraction of what feels like an endless stream of glossy new products, startups and tech. Success in publishing requires focus; allocating resource to channels that offer genuine value to the business and the audience, and being strong enough to say no to the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2018, </span><a href="https://voices.media/flipboard-head-growth-claus-enevoldsen-growing-platform-works-publishers/">Media Voices</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interviewed </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clausenevoldsen/">Claus Enevoldsen</a>, Head of Growth & Product Marketing at Flipboard<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Flipboard tends to offer genuine value to many of our clients and given its startling growth this year – Flipboard now ranks just behind Google News and Twitter for publisher referral traffic –  we’ve collated the key points from the conversation.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="840" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F518297961&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=840&maxheight=1000&dnt=1"></iframe></p>
<h2><b>What is Flipboard?</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> is<span style="font-weight: 400;"> a news and social media aggregation tool. It presents content from online publications, photo sharing platforms and more in a magazine-influenced format which allows users to ‘flip’ through stories easily. </span></p>
<p>Enevoldsen describes Flipboard as a “curation platform where people come to consume quality content”. Their mission, he says, is to “inform and inspire the world.” Flipboard’s audience use the app both to consume fast-moving news and dive more deeply into their personal interests. Stories are catalogued in ‘magazines’ that users create or follow: hubs for the kind of content they regularly read – you could create your own cycling magazine, follow another user’s magazine about music or simply follow publications you love. Flipboard is an ad-supported platform with contextual advertisements, and Enevoldsen claims they have twice the ad recall of other platforms.</p>
<h2><b>Why is it worth our time?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipboard now boasts </span>145 million<span style="font-weight: 400;"> engaged monthly </span>users<span style="font-weight: 400;">. This doesn’t appear to be a vanity metric: Enevoldsen states that “the only way that you’re really part of that number is if you have actively opened…and engaged with Flipboard in any given month”.</span></p>
<p>Enevoldsen claims that Flipboard works on a ‘publisher first’ basis – that “Flipboard won’t succeed if publishers don’t succeed”. It’s a platform-agnostic service, preloaded on Samsung devices and it directs traffic straight to publishers’ sites, allowing them to monetise that traffic in their own environment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 marked a period of rapid growth which Enevoldsen attributes to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A quality experience.</strong> “In this world today, it’s a world of fake news, of dubious sources, and…people are really looking for this…high quality content haven”. Flipboard aims to work only with quality publishers. Their editorial teams will look to a website to confirm queries like ‘does this website have bylines?’, ‘does this website issue corrections?’. Their technical teams will vet websites for red flags such as an abundance of ad pop-ups or slow loading pages.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A shift in collective mindset.</strong> Users are beginning to become more conscious of the time they spend on their phones and Flipboard aims for ‘time well spent’, in which users can reach quality content quickly and easily.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A combination of user experience, strong algorithms and human curation.</strong> Enevoldsen describes Flipboard as “a technology company with media values”, combining a machine learning team with 25-30 editors who ensure algorithms don’t “run amok”. In the Politics section, for instance, Flipboard’s editors curate content from the left, the right and the centre equally, aiming to prevent the algorithm from funnelling one political alignment to a given user.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.fipp.com/news/insightnews/active-consumer-mindset-study">Flipboard conducted a mindset study with Kantar Millward Brown</a>, studying over 2,000 smartphone users in the US and the UK to track motivations for opening social and news apps. Flipboard was compared to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and “…over-indexed dramatically on the motivation to invest in yourself”. Enevoldsen believes that people come to Flipboard to better themselves. “There’s a direct correlation between that, and then spending more time with the articles, and that’s something that the publishers really value.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we at Mathematics were lucky enough to have a chat with Jessica Elsey, Flipboard’s UK News Editor. Jess handles publisher on-boarding and day-to-day editorial management; working with publications and helping them experience every potential benefit that Flipboard has to offer. Flipboard works with over 4000 publishers, content creators and blogs – 250 of which are specific to the UK – and welcome the opportunity to introduce new publishers to the platform. Here’s what Jess had to say.</span></p>
<h2><b>Isn’t Flipboard’s content curation algorithm-led?</b></h2>
<p>The vast majority is, but<span style="font-weight: 400;"> one </span>crucial<span style="font-weight: 400;"> thing that Jess and her team assemble by hand is Flipboard’s daily ‘</span><a href="https://flipboard.com/@flipboard/10-for-today-k6ln1khuz">10 For Today</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ email roundup, a round-up of Flipboard’s favourite articles of the day. </span></p>
<p>I’m looking at today’s, and I can see ‘Is the beauty industry doing enough to tackle plastic pollution?’ on The Independent directly above The Atlantic’s ‘Growing Up in a House Full of Perfect Dogs’. It’s super varied, and quality is the only criterion. Music publishers: I’ve seen list features included, too.</p>
<p>Flipboard has dedicated ‘news teams’ in the UK and the US whose job it is to decide which news is featured in Flipboard. Once a story that covers a certain event is chosen, these news teams consult Flipboard’s partnered publishers to try to find coverage of the same story with an alternative angle. This human side to curation aims to uphold no political bias<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>So what can publishers do to get the most out of Flipboard?</b></h2>
<p>If a publisher wants their content on Flipboard, they must be aware that Flipboard only accepts RSS feeds. Bigger publications should submit multiple RSS feeds to Flipboard, grouped according to topic. <a href="https://flipboard.com/@britishgq/culture-l3n6ucusz">Here</a>’s British GQ’s Culture page, which serves as a great example. Users tend to follow Flipboard Magazines that focus on their interests, rather than specific publications.</p>
<p>In fact, the number of followers on a publisher’s Flipboard profile no longer correlate with success on the platform – historically, Flipboard didn’t have the topic system, so users would follow profiles. Now, though, most traffic is driven through topic feeds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipboard’s team can add Magazines as a recommended source on a selected topic if they feel they offer something unique, and subsequently valuable to a user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to pitch Flipboard’s editorial team content for 10 For Today, a recommended source, or anything else in mind, there’s an email address for that. The team are always welcoming and receptive to pitches.</span></p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t forget<span style="font-weight: 400;">: while these are the most popular topics on Flipboard, they’re also the most populous!</span></p>
<h2><b>Is there anything else I should be aware of?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice a significant traffic spike, it’s likely come from a push notification.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers are notified via email when their content is picked up by curators. This email is sent once the feature is live, not in advance of being featured.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>What does the future look like for Flipboard?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enevoldsen states that Flipboard is already a global platform, with 20% of the audience in the US and 80% in the rest of the world. Historically, the US has been the primary focus, but Europe is now a priority – “we have a dedicated team in Europe, in the UK, that are actively engaging both with advertisers and publishers”.</span></p>
<h2><b>Our take</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parse.ly currently tracks Flipboard as accounting for 1.8% of publishers’ referral traffic, putting them just behind Google News and Twitter. We’re personally seeing relatively regular traffic spikes from Flipboard and while this traffic isn’t yet as valuable for driving loyalty as, say, newsletter traffic or Google News traffic, it’s still of a good quality for the majority of our publishers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, we’d recommend sending that first pitch to Jess and her team, if you haven’t done so already. Introducing and familiarising yourself preemptively will help you get a leg-up on the competition, before Flipboard proliferates further this side of the Atlantic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic from Flipboard clicks through directly to publisher sites, so you’re able to court audiences within your environment, segment the audience and analyse behaviour to drive them from casual visitor to brand lover. Fast page speed is imperative as it’s so easy for the user to jump back into the app and find another result. Lastly, intrusive ads are a big no-no; Flipboard requests no ads on “100% of the first visible page”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipboard face significant competition from <a href="http://mth.me/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a>, but being platform agnostic and publisher focused gives them significant differentiation. </span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well. If nothing else, 2018 was eventful. It was a year of ups and downs for news media thanks to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook’s ‘meaningful interactions’ algorithm</a>. Subscriptions and donations became major sources of income, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Guardian</a> announcing that one million ‘supporters’ (financial donors) put them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/25/guardian-on-track-to-break-even-as-company-halves-its-losses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the brink of breaking even</a> after years of losses, and old skills were framed with a renewed importance. Publishers reclaimed control of newsletters from marketing teams, and SEO skills became more important than ever with Facebook difficult to master.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/people/nic-newman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nic Newman</a> is a Senior Research Associate at the <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism</a>. Here you can find the condensed summary of his predictions for the world of journalism in 2019; the parts that matter most to Mathematics.</span></p>
<h2>Predictions: an Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle against misinformation will turn its focus to closed networks and community groups, where it is harder to control.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll see a renewed focus on trust indicators for news.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll see more users leaving social media and more users concerned about quality time online, as addiction worry kicks in.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow news becomes a theme with the launch of new journalistic enterprises like <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45875284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tortoise</a>; an antidote to the current glut of quick, shallow, and reactive coverage. But how many will join – and pay?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of paywalls is shutting more people off from quality news and making the internet harder to navigate. Consumer irritation will build this year, leading to a combination of more news avoidance and the adoption of ‘paywall-blocking’ software.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Key Trends and Predictions for 2019</b></h2>
<h3><b>Platforms under pressure</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, in response to the spread of false news, </span><b>Facebook</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deployed advanced tech/increased human resources to identify and remove fake accounts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduced new authentication procedures for ad buyers and their affiliations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continued to work with fact-checkers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boosted the prominence of ‘trusted news sources’ in its algorithms</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>WhatsApp </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imposed limits on forwarding from 250 to 20 people max</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>YouTube </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritised trusted sources around breaking news</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attacked economic incentives by making problematic videos un-monetisable</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Twitter </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduced new ways of identifying bots</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter now challenges around 9 million accounts a week to prove that they’re human. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what might happen in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social and search platforms will place increasing focus on the credibility and track record of publishers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 120 news sites – </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including BBC News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – have started to display ‘trust indicators’ on their pages.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hoped that these will provide some objective standards for news sites to pertain to, which will differentiate trustworthy sites from the untrustworthy ones.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to see more labelling initiatives in 2019.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Publishers look to wean themselves off Facebook</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Apple News is now considered as valuable as Facebook, with some publishers reporting sharp rises in traffic. Here’s how publishers rated platforms going into 2019, where % = saying the platform was ‘very’ important:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google – 87%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple News – 43%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook – 43%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube – 43%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram – 31%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter – 29%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp – 16%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon – 16%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapchat – 8%</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google maxes out on importance because of its pervasiveness as both technology and audience provider, and their willingness to engage on some key topics that matter to our business. I can’t say that about any other platform</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” – Spokesperson for UK subscription business</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>From Feeds to Stories</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook says </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/stories-are-about-to-surpass-feed-sharing-now-what/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stories will surpass feeds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the main way people share with friends within the next year</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are used daily by 300 million people on Instagram, 190 million on Snapchat and 150 million people on Facebook (which recently announced it will now facilitate the direct upload of Instagram stories to Facebook stories). AMP stories debuted in 2017, sitting on top of some Google searches</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Something gives at Snapchat</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network is set to lose around $1.5b in 2019 as it tries to self-right after a </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/snap-s-cash-drain-is-becoming-a-big-problem-analyst-says"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series of mistakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snapchat will need to grow “massively faster” than expected and cut costs aggressively. This could manifest as rushed growth paired with serious cutbacks on spending, which could compromise the quality of the app.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>The Business of Journalism</b></h2>
<h3><b>Publishers focus on subscription, but limits become clear</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a survey conducted by Reuters, the following questions on 2019 revenue focus yielded the following spread of answers.</span></p>
<p><i>Which of the following digital revenue streams is MOST important for your company in 2019?</i></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-73949 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.54.24.png" alt="Nic Newman Predictions for Journalism 2019" width="1151" height="281" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.54.24.png 1151w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.54.24-300x73.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.54.24-768x187.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.54.24-1024x250.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px" /></p>
<p><i>Which of the following digital revenue streams are important or very important for your company in 2019?</i></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-73951 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.59.26.png" alt="Nic Newman Predictions for Journalism 2019" width="1134" height="289" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.59.26.png 1134w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.59.26-300x76.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.59.26-768x196.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-10.59.26-1024x261.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1134px) 100vw, 1134px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On these charts, we can see that the “pivot to subscriptions” has begun. Thankfully, with it seems to come an understanding that multiple revenue streams are required to thrive.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscriptions is the key strategy, so the investment in driving subscriptions will be critical in 2019 and probably 2020 to create a sustainable news business.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – Sergio Rodríguez, Digital Editor-in-Chief, La Razón, Spain</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many publications this will require new skills, metrics and an emphasis on creating content that is of a quality that justifies payment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average respondent to the Reuters survey said that four different revenue streams are important to them.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Quality news is disappearing behind paywalls</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many are concerned about the wider implications for democracy if the rich end up with access to higher quality, more trusted information than those who can’t afford to pay. So what will we see in the year ahead?</span></p>

<h3><b>Broken news: could slow news help?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could less journalism be better for society and create more impact? This is the question </span><a href="https://www.tortoisemedia.com/">Tortoise Media</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wants to answer. The project, founded by former BBC Director of News James Harding and Katie Vannick-Smith, former President at the Wall Street Journal, will launch in April 2019, promising a ‘different kind of newsroom’. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will largely ignore breaking news, but tackle </span>four<span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span>five<span style="font-weight: 400;"> stories a </span>day<span style="font-weight: 400;"> through its </span>website<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>app<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span>newsletter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tortoise is targeting 40,000 paying subscribers by the end of the year.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Collaboration on the rise</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are the results for the following question in a Reuters survey:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-73952 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.03.56.png" alt="Nic Newman Predictions for Journalism 2019" width="1110" height="299" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.03.56.png 1110w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.03.56-300x81.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.03.56-768x207.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.03.56-1024x276.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers are less willing to share sources and resources than advertising and tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadly I think publishers should look to a model where we share technology which solves our common issues and then use our journalism to differentiate our output.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – UK publisher</span></p>
<h3><b>Concerns about talent and burnout in the newsroom</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were the top concerns of newsroom leaders, according to a Reuters survey:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-73953 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.05.21.png" alt="Nic Newman Predictions for Journalism 2019" width="1075" height="295" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.05.21.png 1075w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.05.21-300x82.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.05.21-768x211.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.05.21-1024x281.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1075px) 100vw, 1075px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burnout concerns were most keenly felt in editorial roles whereas talent attraction and retention issues applied particularly to product and technical roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><b><i>Leading a group of product, UX and tech, News and Media is a long way from first choice for most talented staff.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – Product Head, leading UK publisher</span></p>
<h3><b>Diversity in the newsroom</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s becoming increasingly apparent to publishers that they cannot afford to alienate a particular audience. In 2019, expect more awareness of the link between diversity and business success.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More newsrooms will start to use tools like </span><a href="https://www.ir.com/prognosis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prognosis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that monitor gender and ethnic diversity of content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This awareness will in turn make editors aware of their own biases.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Personalisation and recommendation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalisation of the news service is critical, but does not mean just handing over editorial judgement to algorithms…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – UK publisher</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional publishers must consider how to use AI responsibly and transparently. A good example of this in effect is the Finnish broadcaster YLE, as it develops its AI, the ‘intelligent assistant’, ‘</span><a href="https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2018/10/12/the-first-of-its-kind-in-the-world-yle-newswatchs-smart-voitto-assistant-shows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voitto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’. Voitto collects feedback on AI-driven recommendations and presents them to user on their phone’s lock screen, aiming to build an ongoing dialogue around the habits and choices of users.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Audio and voice in 2019</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers think audio presents a big opportunity in 2019:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-73954 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.07.16.png" alt="" width="1129" height="526" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.07.16.png 1129w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.07.16-300x140.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.07.16-768x358.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-25-at-11.07.16-1024x477.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1129px) 100vw, 1129px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice-activated technology/audio will be one of several platforms suited for certain types of news consumption (morning briefing, for example). The danger is a ‘pivot to video’ [transition, where publishers think video will become] THE dominant platform/journey.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – UK publisher</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy access, better discovery and millions of new audio devices suggests there is considerable growth left in the podcast market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google will make podcasts a “first-class citizen”, meaning they will appear alongside the text, image, and video results you are used to seeing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcast listening experiences will be seamless across devices and contexts thanks to Google Assistant.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Opportunities for publishers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While publishers recognise that voice will be a major disruption, they are not clear about whether now is the right time to invest. Reuters’ study suggests that the take up of news content was disappointing. Just 22% use news briefings daily in the UK and 17% in the US. Only 1% said that news was the most important feature, compared with 64% who cited playing music and 17% who said checking the weather. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help optimise for voice, expect to see platforms pushing publishers to use a new metadata specification called ‘speakable schema’, which will make for a much better and more accurate voice search experience.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Next Generation Technologies</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folding phones could double smartphone screen size.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phone companies will look to shift their business models away from volatile hardware sales towards subscription packages. Expect to see more phones essentially leased using services like the Apple upgrade programme. Leased phones could mean users upgrade more often, and subscription packages could lead to the bundling of content within these deals.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>New startups to watch in 2019</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://kinzen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinzen</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a new subscription-based news aggregator app that is built on the premise that people want to spend time with more meaningful media, and it aims to create daily routines that are time limited, personalised and hopefully mind-broadening.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.curio.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Curio</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a paid app that curates high quality audio content from the Guardian, FT, The Economist and Washington Post, amongst others. There are no ads, and an annual subscription costs $59.</span></li>
<li><a href="http://agate.one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Agate</strong></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a digital wallet that allows you to pay for premium articles as you go, aiming to make it easier to consume content from multiple brands without hitting paywalls. The problem will be attaining a critical mass of publishers to take part.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Conclusions</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers are re-focusing on loyalty and building relationships with readers, whether paywall funded or advertising funded.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups like Tortoise and Kinzen are concentrating on building strong communities from the start, as well as emphasising values and principles that will underpin their journalism.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio is showing signs of promise with a younger generation that is discovering quality speech content for the first time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence offers the possibility of more personal and relevant news services, new ways to uncover stories, as well as more efficient ways of packaging and distributing content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">News organisations will need to be clearer than ever about that they stand for and the audience they are serving.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ll also need to find ways to combine their unique human resources with this new wave of technologies to maximise their potential to create more engaging and sustainable journalism going forward. </span></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Mathematics, we work with media companies. It’s no secret that SEO for publishers is becoming more difficult. As time marches on, an increasing number of brands spend incrementally larger sums of money deploying cutting-edge SEO strategy, making for some stiff competition. All the while, Google is quietly moving the goalposts in mysterious directions. TL;DR – optimising your publication’s site for search engines is becoming the kind of dark art you feared it was when you first made SEO attempts of your own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s daunting for everybody. So, we’ve tried to narrow down some fool-proof techniques to adopt in 2019; the kind which are guaranteed to help this year, not mere suggestions (though there are some of those suggestions at the end of this entry, too). Here are some tips that allow us to optimise pages without heavily infringing on journalistic content. As such, the emphasis here is on technical SEO, as opposed to what can be done with copywriting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, without further ado…</span></p>
<h2><b>The SEO techniques publishers must consider in 2019</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b><b><b>Schema tags/structured data: <span style="font-weight: 400;">schema markup helps search engines return more informative results. Google uses this to generate ‘rich snippets’; small pieces of information that are formatted clearly in search results. For example, in publishing, schema tags around an author’s name should, in theory, cause that article to rank higher than a mention of the name in a body of text without any schema tags. Think of them as indicators of importance.</span></b></b></b></li>
<li><b>Mobile-first indexing: <span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ll know that this means the mobile version of your site becomes the starting point for Google includes in their index, and the foundation for determining rank. If your mobile and desktop rankings are the same and you’re happy with your SERP ranking, nothing to worry about. If your area of work dictates that you prioritise mobile, then do the following:</span></b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your mobile version features all the high-quality content of your desktop. In fact, make sure your mobile version features everything the desktop version does, including structured data, equivalent metadata and Twitter cards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve only verified the desktop version of your site, be sure to add and verify the mobile version</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement mobile switchboard tags</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b><b><b>Page speed: <span style="font-weight: 400;">optimise your URLs, keep those images small. </span><a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ImageOptim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an incredibly straightforward way of making your image files as small as possible before compromising quality. Page speed is a key ranking factor, so this is tremendously important.</span></b></b></b></li>
<li><b><b><b>Improving existing content to ensure Google recognises that it responds to the search intent of the user directly. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalists can incorporate this into their workflow by writing the best stuff they can, while ensuring their headlines don’t exceed 55 characters and their metadescriptions don’t exceed 300 characters. </span><a href="https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoSchedule’s Headline Analyser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an excellent way for journalists to stay on top of this, aiming for a score of 70 or higher. Developers can help too with well organised schema tags/structured data.</span></b></b></b></li>
<li><b><b><b>On-page SEO for NLP (Natural Language Processing): <span style="font-weight: 400;">NLP is the name given to Google’s capability to help it better understand the information on your page. NLP concerns the clarity and structure of your writing, and the relationship between words. Develop an understanding of NLP, incorporate it into your writing workflow, and Google will love you. </span><a href="https://www.briggsby.com/on-page-seo-for-nlp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s a crazily in-depth rundown explanation of NLP and how to deploy it.</span></b></b></b></li>
<li><b><b>Google Correlate: <span style="font-weight: 400;">a terrifyingly useful tool. Enter the keyword you want to rank for, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">then, shift series to, say, -2 weeks, which means you will be given a list of terms people search for two weeks before they are likely to type in your keyword. Essentially, you’ll be able to predict – with a degree of accuracy – what users are going to search for. Obviously, this is gold for planning content. One for Charlie Brooker, this.</span></b></b></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Also worth considering:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Voice search!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This won’t necessarily proliferate in 2019, but it’s worth keeping an eye on and planning for. </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/02/15/voice-search-seo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s some tips for the voice search ‘revolution’.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy! Sort of. Some of these are more obvious than others, but we reckon that incorporating these into your SEO strategy for 2019 will be a big help. We expect that your competitors will be taking similar steps, too, so better get cracking.</span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Winning out in distributed publishing requires solid evaluation of how each platform contributes to your goals as a publisher. Naturally, digging into data is key to understanding if your approach is working and how to build further growth. With this in mind we asked Barney Perkins, our Data Analyst, to guide us through an in-depth look at <a href="http://mth.me/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a> analytics.</p>
<h2 id="05f3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">The Dashboard</strong></h2>
<p id="1eea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Apple’s commitment to preserving user privacy means integration with Google Analytics isn’t possible. Analysis takes place within Apple’s own analytics dashboard or by manually downloading data for use in systems like <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Studio</a>.</p>
<p id="d589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Let’s look at some of the key metrics we monitor within Apple News.</p>
<h2 id="7aad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><img class="size-full wp-image-75475 alignnone" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_aj2LWKl9gWagjfEGyAKo7Q-1.gif" alt="" width="895" height="781" /></strong></h2>
<h2 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Views</strong></h2>
<p id="1be8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple News measures both the unique and total views an article receives. We have observed significant differences between unique views on Apple News and how the same content performs on its publisher’s website. These figures often correlate negatively, perhaps indicating differences in audience interest and the way that Apple News promotes content.</p>
<p id="d338" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The former is difficult to establish given the limited ways Apple allows us to segment audience data. To drill this down you’ll need to manually track content and performance, which will allow you to better understand the Apple News audience and identify untapped potential for content on other platforms.</p>
<h2 id="4c0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Reach</strong></h2>
<p id="ecc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple News defines reach as headline views plus article views. Reach closely matches unique views and both are inversely correlated with the proportion of traffic that comes from recirculation. The articles that do a higher proportion of traffic through recirculation don’t seem to get as much reach as those that get the majority of their traffic from the Today Feed, as more users tend to discover content from their personalised topic feeds than the ‘Related’ section at the bottom of an article.</p>
<h2 id="25e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Follows</strong></h2>
<p id="8d3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A user that taps to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Follow</strong> a publication will be shown more content from that title across the Today Feed — the homepage of the app. A direct link to the publication’s channel in News will also appear in navigation. Naturally, then, building followers is key to driving growth.</p>
<p id="ea53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The accumulated Follows a publication receives prior to the date an article went live exhibits a positive correlation with unique views. By monitoring data across the publications we handle, we believe Follows don’t just affect reach for those that follow, they send a signal to Apple’s algorithm to expose more stories to other users, too. As your number of followers increases, you can expect to see the size of spikes in traffic increase significantly.</p>
<p id="49be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Upon opening your publications’ Follows page, you’ll be presented with a simple chart displaying net follows per day in a given time period, and net follows across the whole of that period. Audience segmentation is available by territory. At the moment this comprises the US, UK and Australian audiences in which Apple News is currently available.</p>
<p id="590b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><img class="size-full wp-image-75476 alignnone" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_6HCG23NMq5UnO6nUa2fO7g-1.gif" alt="" width="895" height="442" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The grey dots along the x-axis (above) mark significant events for your articles — being featured in Spotlight, being featured in an Editorial Group (eg. News Editor’s Picks or Top Videos), appearing in an Apple email, sending out a push notification or being ‘boosted’ by Apple Editors.</p>
<figure id="attachment_75477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75477" style="width: 534px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-75477" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1__cGK0vuzDxscFCEZksVFNg-1.jpeg" alt="" width="534" height="589" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1__cGK0vuzDxscFCEZksVFNg-1.jpeg 534w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1__cGK0vuzDxscFCEZksVFNg-1-272x300.jpeg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75477" class="wp-caption-text">An “Editorial Group” — News Editors’ Picks</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="8209" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Notifications</strong></h2>
<p id="00a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Notifications can be sent to followers by publishers who have been invited by Apple to deliver them. Click-through rate tends to be consistent across publications, but frequency of these notifications needs to be considered; ‘over-notifying’ will lead users to remove notifications for your publication. Notification click-through rate appears to be weighted significantly in favour of iPhone users and in particular males aged 25–34.</p>
<p id="d3bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Notifications can be used to increase the lifespan of articles that aren’t time sensitive. We believe an effective strategy is to monitor the performance of a piece within its first 24 hours in Apple News, then send a notification. This will give you much more of an indication around interest in the story than sending immediately or following website analytics, as popular stories on Apple News can vary significantly.</p>
<h2 id="9322" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Shares</strong></h2>
<p id="28b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shares relate to users clicking the Share button within the app, with analytics grouped according to the platform they were shared through: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mail, Messages, Twitter, Facebook and Other</strong>. For most of the publishers we work with, the vast majority of these shares are categorised as ‘Other’. Often as high as 98%, this inhibits comprehensive analysis of shares. Given that the majority of Apple News users are on iPhone, we suspect that ‘Other’ shares come from WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or other dark social.</p>
<p id="2a1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Shares outside of Apple News aren’t trackable in Google Analytics, but at FlatPlan we include trackable links in template footers, allowing publishers to track user behaviour if they leave the platform to visit the publisher website.</p>
<h2 id="bb6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Discovery Source</strong></h2>
<p id="19f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Discovery Source breaks down how users land on your content. Traffic is broken down according to multiple measures: the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Today </strong>feed (the homepage and default view on Apple News), your channel page, topic feeds (the Entertainment topic page, for instance), recirculation (the area below articles), push notifications, Spotlight, the Today View (the most prominent area of the main page controlled by Apple News editors) and “Other” (which could include external shares to the app article).</p>
<p id="6b5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><img class="size-full wp-image-75478 alignnone" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_iefbRU4U1BRCdBEG-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="750" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_iefbRU4U1BRCdBEG-1.png 1200w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_iefbRU4U1BRCdBEG-1-300x188.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_iefbRU4U1BRCdBEG-1-768x480.png 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_iefbRU4U1BRCdBEG-1-1024x640.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Being featured in <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Spotlight</strong> means Apple News editors’ have chosen your story to sit alongside 4–5 others, sitting within a very prominent tab in the app. While being featured here can be a significant traffic driver — particularly if a story is featured on the weekend — don’t regard Spotlight as the holy grail. We often see much higher spikes of traffic to stories surfaced through recirculation, the Today Feed or Topic Feeds — in essence the whole ecosystem works well to help expose certain stories.</p>
<p id="cef5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the whole, there is limited demographic data available in Discovery Source to advise on how a channel retains readers, or — in conjunction with other metrics — identify how popular articles can drive traffic to the rest of one’s content. But, with significant deviations from the norm regarding gender or age, for example, an estimate of how traffic flows through the channel can be established.</p>
<h2 id="35d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Loyalty</strong></h2>
<p id="a944" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple News calculates loyalty by dividing users by the number of articles they’ve read in the past 28 days, or by the number of days they’ve visited out of the past 28. These numbers will match up almost exactly, and you can use either approach to gauge the loyalty of your users.</p>
<p id="5f68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At Mathematics we group users by Casual, Loyal, Brand Lover and Subscriber, and using similar measures in Apple News we find Brand Lovers are generally more stable, although this varies a surprising amount across publications. Whilst there is a strong correlation between the behaviours of Casual, Loyal and Brand Lover users, the correlation relaxes significantly the heavier the user, suggesting that it will take time to build core audiences, but that those audiences will follow normal behaviour and spend more time with your content.</p>
<p id="ebc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Aside from the ways in which we can monitor and drive growth with News Publisher, here are some other points to consider when using the platform:</em></p>
<h2 id="fd2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Article Lifespan</strong></h2>
<p id="cd5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Articles featured on Apple News tend to have a three day lifespan. A feature in Spotlight, Editorial Group or a notification can extend this lifespan up to a couple of weeks, however — effectively doubling its number of unique views.</p>
<h2 id="3f30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Significance of Date</strong></h2>
<p id="ed32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The distribution of unique views over days of the week differs from title to title. After accounting for the significant differences in traffic across a number of publications, the following distribution was found for the the month of October, 2018:</p>
<h2 id="532f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><img class="size-full wp-image-75479 alignnone" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0_OW5iGSAjtMvbVCgP-1.png" alt="" width="235" height="145" /></strong></h2>
<h2 class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Demographics</strong></h2>
<p id="3d9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are notable demographic discrepancies across current Apple News’ territories. US audiences seem to be considerably older than in the UK and Australia, with the UK’s audience the youngest. UK and Australian audiences were also generally more likely to use Apple News on iPad. When these are significantly different for a given article, it is possible to predict traffic flow by identifying similar discrepancies. This can be done by cross referencing with other metrics like discovery source and/or time.</p>
<p id="9e9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is worth mentioning that there can, at different times, be significant differences in what content audiences find appealing according to territory.</p>
<h2 id="bbfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p id="f3c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple’s commitment to privacy limits the level of analysis or correlation with other analytics tools, but by focusing on overall publisher goals, tracking these and using Apple News analytics carefully, it’s possible to measure and increase growth on the platform.</p>
<p id="e87d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Building loyalty from the right audience is key to driving consistent growth, with Follows having the most significant effect on the increase of loyal users. Understanding which content works well on Apple News involves manually processing article data, and stories that spike can often differ heavily from content that does well elsewhere, which can be used to help social teams try to resurface content that didn’t gain traction elsewhere.</p>
<p id="b55f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spotlight and other Apple News curated areas can drive huge spikes of traffic but the ecosystem as a whole works very well for exposing good stories and depending on the niche of the publication huge spikes from general audiences tend to be less value compared to solid traffic from audiences directed by specific interest or through similar publications.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has rolled out two big changes to <a href="http://mth.me/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a> in the last few weeks, following their annual Keynote event in Cupertino. We felt it would be useful to give a quick rundown on these changes and how they might affect your Apple News strategy moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="b851" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Change 1: iPhone/iPad facelift</strong></h2>
<p id="5314" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Open Apple News now and you’ll notice a number of changes to the look and feel. On iPhone, navigation is now reduced from five icons down to three — Today, Spotlight and Channels. Today replaces “For You” and Spotlight works as it did before, with Channels now offering a route into publications, topics of interest, saved stories and search. On iPad, navigation is now displayed as a slide-out drawer, with Channels listed in order of priority on-screen whenever navigation is expanded.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-73651 size-large aligncenter" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1uBoWIVPzvDP1o3Ed-iAztQ-768x1024.jpeg" alt="Apple News" width="768" height="1024" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1uBoWIVPzvDP1o3Ed-iAztQ-768x1024.jpeg 768w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1uBoWIVPzvDP1o3Ed-iAztQ-225x300.jpeg 225w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1uBoWIVPzvDP1o3Ed-iAztQ.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p id="9d57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The app now displays a wider range of stories across a number of views. More space is given to topics and areas like Your Briefings, News Editors’ Picks and News Top Stories help guide users into content arranged by interest or browsing history.</p>
<h2 id="aa53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Change 2: Apple News on desktop</strong></h2>
<p id="b1d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Last week Apple launched Mojave, a new operating system for Mac computers. News is now bundled with this OS, appearing prominently on a walk-through of the new system, with an icon appearing in the dock at all times.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-73679 size-full aligncenter" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_EVOiR4vJ5HXToM1HTXmNWg.png" alt="Apple News" width="800" height="498" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_EVOiR4vJ5HXToM1HTXmNWg.png 800w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_EVOiR4vJ5HXToM1HTXmNWg-300x187.png 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_EVOiR4vJ5HXToM1HTXmNWg-768x478.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p id="6cb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The macOS version is similar to News on iPad, making use of slide-out navigation and a window that opens at a similar view to iPad portrait. Users with linked Apple accounts will notice the app is linked to their devices, sharing publications, interests, saved links and viewing history. Notifications from publishers appear on desktop whenever the app is open.</p>
<h2 id="55b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How does this affect your Apple News strategy?</strong></h2>
<p id="fd07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple’s updates to look and feel are likely to aid users to find a wider range of content they’ll enjoy. The new setup means your stories have a higher likelihood of appearing within streams of content and topic groupings give more opportunity for stories to appear to those who don’t follow your publication. Apple’s algorithms and natural language processing handle how these appear, so aside from creating well-written, clearly defined content, you don’t need to do anything more here.</p>
<p id="111f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><img class="size-medium wp-image-73680 alignleft" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_16Mu2yXZm7WYcQtm5D3PFQ-300x241.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="241" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_16Mu2yXZm7WYcQtm5D3PFQ-300x241.jpeg 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_16Mu2yXZm7WYcQtm5D3PFQ.jpeg 552w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Channels give more opportunity to drive users to your channel, particularly on iPad and Mac where your publication name appears prominently. Apple recommends uploading an icon to drive brand recognition — if we look after your publication on News we’ve done this for you already.</p>
<p id="b034" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More prominent channel links put more emphasis on ensuring the page users arrive to is as compelling as possible. Our advice is to ensure all stories appear on the first tab — removing sections completely may even make sense in many cases. Promoted Articles allow you to maximise impact by pushing your very best stories to the top of your channel. To promote an article, log in to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icloud.com%2F%23newspublisher" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icloud.com%2F%23newspublisher">News Publisher</a> and hit the star icon. Promoted articles remove themselves from the top of the page after a few days.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-73681 size-full aligncenter" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_t-Ly6vof6gelQhnIwcCF5Q.jpeg" alt="Apple News" width="800" height="57" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_t-Ly6vof6gelQhnIwcCF5Q.jpeg 800w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_t-Ly6vof6gelQhnIwcCF5Q-300x21.jpeg 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_t-Ly6vof6gelQhnIwcCF5Q-768x55.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p id="88d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If you’re a Preferred Partner, Apple News appearing on macOS gives a new opportunity to reach a ‘bored at work’ audience. We’d recommend testing notifications at times users at work are likely to be looking for a short distraction. Analytics on your main site will give clues to these timings but behaviour may differ on Apple News so trial a few times and dig into Apple’s analytics for data. It’s worth keeping an eye on competitors if they have notification functionality — users who arrive through notifications may, of course, dive into the article stream (and potentially see your content), so avoiding crossover could help increase impact.</p>
<p id="cfb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As Apple News grows we’d suggest a focus on increasing publication follows. The user that clicks the heart icon is much more likely to see your stories and if you have notifications enabled they’ll receive this prompt. FlatPlan is the only system that allows Call to Actions for this in footers and we’re testing functionality to help increase follows which we’ll be messaging about soon, but it’s certainly worth thinking about how to drive follows from an editorial perspective as well.</p>
<p id="539f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">One final thought from us — behaviour is likely to change as more people use the app across new devices. Apple News doesn’t sync with Google Analytics so make sure your team keep an eye on Apple’s analytics. You can set your team up to receive a daily, weekly or monthly analytics report by email — to do this head to Analytics > Recurring Report or just hit reply if you’d like us to help.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week Facebook opened Instant Articles up to all publishers, allowing mobile users to view articles within the Facebook app. Wondering if it’s for you? Here’s a short Q&A.</p>
<h2><strong>What is it?</strong></h2>
<p>Instant Articles allow publishers to host their content within Facebook’s app for users on mobile. A little like Google’s AMP initiative, the main aim is to speed up loading times for mobile users.</p>
<h2><strong>How will it help?</strong></h2>
<p>Facebook say the result should be a 20% increase in opens, a 10x faster load time and a 70% decrease in abandonment. The Wall Street Journal have reported a 30% increase in shares, too.</p>
<h2><strong>A 20% increase in opens?</strong></h2>
<p>According to Facebook, yes. And Facebook claim they haven’t (yet) boosted the visibility of Instant Articles. Facebook uses the number of shares and how long people look at an article to decide how much visibility to give a story, so all three metrics working together to increase open rate.</p>
<h2><strong>Who is it open to?</strong></h2>
<p>Any publisher with a Facebook Page.</p>
<h2><strong>Can we run ads across Instant Articles?</strong></h2>
<p>You can. Publishers keep 100% of the revenue generated by ads they sell themselves, which can be served through most ad servers, including Google DFP. You can also incorporate Facebook ads, with profits from this split between Facebook and the publisher.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s the downside?</strong></h2>
<p>By handing our content over to Facebook <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/08/18/facebook-google/">user reliance on the platform is increasing</a>. Our reliance has led to a shift in the way Facebook monetises the network.</p>
<p>When the platform first launched, Facebook banned native advertising and their guidelines only allow for one ad per 350 words. But native advertising is now allowed, and honestly, their ad policy helps the end user. It is however a reminder that Facebook will be in complete control of your content, so if you come to rely on it for traffic, then expect the model to change relatively regularly.</p>
<p>Publishers have to fit content into a template that leaves very little room for branding and feels ‘very Facebook’. There’s a real risk of losing a certain amount of connection with readers – you get a logo bar that appears near the top of the page, some typeface and colourway choices, but that’s about it (you can see our design for Mixmag at the bottom of the page, showing customisable areas). From a commercial point of view there’s also a real worry that publishers are giving away the very identity that often drives advertisers to work directly with their teams, too.</p>
<p>And from a technical point of view, full mobile navigation isn’t allowed, infinite scroll isn’t possible and the ‘related articles’ area is limited, so opportunities to draw users into further clicks are limited.</p>
<h2><strong>Any advice?</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the downsides we feel Instant Articles should certainly be tested by publishers – but it’s the testing that’s important.</p>
<p>Keep a very close eye on Google Analytics. Segment by Mobile, then look at how Instant Articles perform over time, taking particular note of Pages Per Session and Bounce Rate.</p>
<p>It’s possible to set your feed up to allow editorial to decide whether or not a post should appear on Instant Articles, and while this doesn’t allow A/B testing in a traditional sense, this level of control will help you direct certain articles through to your site. You may find certain types of article perform much better when removed from Instant Article templates, so it’s well worth experimenting with this.</p>
<p>The lack of navigation or space for related article plugs means it’s more important than ever to weave related stories into articles. Assure your linking practice is on top of its game, and continually experiment with different internal to external link ratios, as there’s no one-size-fits-all rule for all publications on that. As your content starts to be distributed across platforms like this it’s a good idea to revisit article structure with editorial and design teams.</p>
<h2><strong>How do we get started?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook’s microsite</a> is a good place to start with Instant Articles. Your options from here depend on your CMS and your budget. Take a look at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/guides/design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook’s dev portal</a> for a rundown of options or, of course, feel free to <a href="http://mth.me/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get in touch</a> with us for a chat.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google News still tends to be a great source of traffic for publishers, and with the advent of Accelerated Mobile Pages – and a few key changes to the product – it felt the time was right for a post on the product. We’ve included some tips on how to treat breaking stories, a lowdown on Accelerated Mobile Pages and some advice on increasing – and sustaining – visibility across the platform.</p>
<p>In a past life, Google News was only really beneficial for news organisations in the traditional sense. But things have since improved! Google News now welcomes all manner of publications that cover stories on specific cultural areas. For instance, here’s the NME rubbing shoulders with BBC and Sky News as its story appears in Google’s rich cards:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-75610 size-full" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Keith-Flint-Google-News.png" alt="Keith Flint Google News" width="685" height="368" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Keith-Flint-Google-News.png 685w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Keith-Flint-Google-News-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></p>
<p>If you want your publication could benefit from what Google News has to offer, then here’s all our advice for getting the most out of the service.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-74809 size-full aligncenter" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/googlenews-1.jpg" alt="Google News for Publishers" width="800" height="400" srcset="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/googlenews-1.jpg 800w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/googlenews-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/googlenews-1-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>First up – is your sitemap in place?</h2>
<p>You need an XML News Sitemap to ensure Google can actually list your content. News sitemaps are similar to standard sitemaps but with one big difference: they only contain articles published in the last two days. Google will still scan your standard sitemap for overall content, and scan your News sitemap separately. Google keeps each article on Google News for 30 days as standard.</p>
<p>If you don’t run a News sitemap, take a look at <a href="https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/74288?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s introduction to sitemaps</a> – this will take you through the basics and includes a number of links to sitemap creators. If your site runs on WordPress we’d recommend working with <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoast’s News SEO plugin.</a> It costs $69 per site and creates a sitemap Google will love after you spend a little time configuring the product. For the likes of Craft, Drupal, ExpressionEngine or more bespoke content management systems, it’s worth taking a look at <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/sitemap-generators/wikis/SitemapGenerators.wiki#Google_News_Sitemap_Generators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s documentation</a> or <a href="http://mth.me/contact/">getting in touch</a> with us for a chat.</p>
<h3>Submitting your site to Google News</h3>
<p>Once you’ve got a sitemap that <a href="https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/74288?hl=en-GB#sitemapguidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follows Google’s guidelines</a>, head to <a href="https://partnerdash.google.com/partnerdash/d/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google News Publisher Centre</a> to submit your site. Prepare a brief description of your site and wait for approval, which can take several weeks. Once you’re live, it’s time to look at how to optimise your site to attract News traffic…</p>
<h3>Accelerated Mobile Pages</h3>
<p>Site speed is <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/google-will-now-favor-pages-use-fast-loading-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an important ranking factor for Google</a> and Accelerated Mobile Pages (or AMP) is Google’s latest initiative in its drive to speed up the web. AMPs are designed to serve users stripped-back versions of pages from your site. Design, Javascript and lots of functionality (like contact forms and comments) will be removed from the AMP version of your site, so this limits the amount you can do with users once they’ve arrived. But as AMP compatibility is a now a search-ranking indicator for mobile, it’s well worth providing AMP sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Depending on which CMS you use, you may need a bespoke plugin built for AMP, though plugins are available for some systems. We recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automattic’s</a> plugin for WordPress.</p>
<p>While lots of content is stripped from pages, ads served on certain networks can still be shown. Most notably Google Adsense, Doubleclick, AOL AdTech and Amazon A9, with more on the way. A full list is available <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/amp-ad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Standouts and Editor’s Picks</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-74810 size-full aligncenter" src="http://mth.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/editorspicks.gif" alt="Google News for Publishers" width="326" height="330" /></p>
<p>Google News now allows you to select certain stories from your site as “Editor’s Picks” to appear on the Google News homepage. Google’s aim is to help their users discover new sources of news, and as part of this aim they allow users to set preferences. If your publication makes it into their preferences you’re much more likely to gain clicks from the News homepage.</p>
<p>To participate, you’ll need to create a custom RSS feed with up to five chosen stories. The feed needs to include your logo, an authors name and must always contain three articles. Google allows older stories in the feed but it only shows the feed if an item is added within 48 hours. More information on that <a href="https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/1407682?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Standout tag works similarly, but on individual stories. You can only use this on seven stories a week, but using this tag in your setup allows you to signal to Google that a story is original content produced by your team, giving it a higher chance of ranking on Google News.</p>
<h3>And finally, some tips on extending your reach</h3>
<p>Google crawls certain news sites more often that others, and one big factor appears to be the amount of articles it finds on each crawl, so posting plenty seems to have an effect on how quickly your articles are listed. As with SEO as a whole, however, avoid attempting to game the system. Posting fewer articles of a higher quality is in the longterm more beneficial to your ranking than frequently firing out low quality stories.</p>
<p>Getting listed quickly helps increase your chances of attracting users as a story breaks, but how should you run a breaking story that updates during the day? The best approach is not to create a separate article for each update, but instead update the original article each time. What’s important, however, is that Google knows you’ve updated the story. Make this clear by updating the title of the article. Google is essentially looking for one URL that serves as the best possible source of news on any given subject, rather than multiple separate articles. This helps divert search traffic away from Google News, too, as these sorts of articles tend to work better across search engines.</p>
