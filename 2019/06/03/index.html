More specifically, the ways it favours surfacing almost everything except publisher content in users’ timelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, paradoxically, a </span><a href="https://digiday.com/media/digiday-research-facebook-still-delivers-the-greatest-reach-for-publishers-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent Digiday survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates that with no alternatives of similar stature, 70% of publishers contend that Facebook still delivers the best content reach of all platforms.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75925" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-paid-or-promoted-campaigns-BORDER.png" alt="Which platform provides the greatest reach for paid or promoted campaigns" width="678" height="745"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for unpaid content circulated organically, 45% of publishers agreed that Facebook was still top dog.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75927" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Which-platform-provides-the-greatest-reach-for-unpaid-posted-content-BORDER.png" alt="Which platform provides the greatest reach for unpaid posted content" width="678" height="745"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we sat down with our analyst Barney Perkins to work out how specifically to use the platform to your advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffer, the social media management platform, have found that posting five times a day maximises post engagement. Read more about that </span><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/new-report-suggests-optimal-facebook-posting-frequency-following-algorithm/530514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, we have decided to focus our investigation on the metrics most easily monetised - reach and sessions referred to the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the algorithm changes, Facebook’s official suggestion is that post rate should not have an effect on reach. This is because the way content is allocated to a user’s news feed depends on relevance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Post frequently - Don't worry about over-posting. The goal of News Feed is to show each person the most relevant story so not all of your posts are guaranteed to show in their Feeds.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” - Facebook</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if this is true, post rate might still influence the visibility of a publication's content by diluting its average relevance and/or increasing the competition in users’ News Feeds - from the publication and from competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The below analysis looks at the daily total reach (taken from Facebook Insights) and number of posts of a publication’s Facebook page (from Social Insider). It also displays the number of sessions referred to the publication’s website (from Google Analytics). Though there is some ambiguity about whether reach or sessions are more valuable metrics, both are given equal preference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By conducting a simple linear regression of both reach and sessions on the number of daily posts, we found that there was indeed a negative correlation between post rate and reach, as well as a positive correlation between post rate and the number of sessions.</span></p>
<h2>Model 1: Reach</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75930" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Reach-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's Reach to Posts Per Day" width="678" height="478"></p>
<h2>Model 2: Sessions</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75929" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-Sessions-to-Posts-Per-Day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's Sessions to Posts Per Day" width="678" height="489"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By aggregating the above graphs, we found that the optimal number of Facebook posts per day was 11. But, make some considerations here. Firstly, the model specification is not a perfect fit of the data. In other words, it’s unlikely that had the publication started posting 40 times a day, there would be <0 reach, indicated by the red line:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75928" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/Aggregated-graph-of-a-publications-users-to-posts-per-day-BORDER.png" alt="Aggregated graph of a publication's users to posts per day" width="678" height="529"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One model we experimented with suggested an optimal post rate of 16 posts per day but behaved very strangely in the extremes. As total followers increased the optimal number of posts would drop down to <1 with an absurdly high expected reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, the model we’ve focussed on here suggests that publications should aim to post to Facebook 11 times per day, with an exception for content that might have a considerably broad appeal. Perhaps questions of optimum post rate are also questions of what content is most relevant to the highest number of the publication’s followers.</span></p>

As the project progressed we discussed integration with <a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flatplan-apple-news/">Apple News</a> and the team’s desired outcomes from their Apple News channel. We were acutely aware that here was a publication described by The New York Times as ‘</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/style/the-face-magazine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a magazine that changed culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’, so with the weight of a great reputation bearing down, we were careful not to compromise The Face’s iconic brand. So, we designed an Apple News channel to communicate The Face’s position at the vanguard of British youth culture, harnessing the exposure Apple News offers by surfacing stories to users based around interests and browsing behaviours.</span></p>
<h2><b>What did The Face require?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Face aims to circumvent “feed culture” - they don't have a Facebook page and instead of posting quickfire articles regularly they deliver a small amount of content to a consistently high standard. This bold approach requires building loyal audiences that come to The Face through quality platforms like Apple News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Face’s focus is on youth culture, but one needn’t be a young person to enjoy its content. The team covers such a breadth of culture that any reader is able to quickly find an article pertaining to their interests. Unlike other publications of the same genre, The Face was relaunched as an already-influential brand. As such, its deeply-ingrained principles were well known, and the first task for us at Mathematics was assuring that they were never compromised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music, fashion, film and art are the areas most widely reported on by The Face, though the publication’s remit extends beyond the creative industries. For instance, here’s the piece leading their Apple News channel at the time of writing:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75906 size-full" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Americas-Scariest-Motel-story-on-The-Faces-Apple-News-Channel-BORDER.png" alt="America's Scariest Motel story on The Face's Apple News Channel BORDER" width="678" height="408"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This plays to The Face’s advantage in Apple News. The platform’s algorithm works to learn a person's interests, and its UI surfaces stories of interest to that person. This, coupled with the variety of its content, broadens The Face’s opportunities to appear as a ‘Related Story’ suggestion below content from huge publishers of all types. Content will also appear in a person's personalised news feed, based either on context or personal taste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The editorial team had to work doubly hard to launch with heaps of content worthy of The Face’s reputation;  the last thing they needed in the planning and development stages was more work. Therefore, it was essential that Apple News integration was as simple and as smooth as possible without interfering with the team’s hectic schedules:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We worked on setting up The Face on Apple News at the same time we were launching the website, so we needed experts to handle the integration without draining our resource at such a critical time. Because the Mathematics team have so much experience and insight with Apple News, we completely trusted them to lead the project, which they did brilliantly. They were able to handle all the tech work, while also translating our overall design identity to work on the platform</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">." - Bridget Mills-Powell, Digital Director</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, a publication so devoted to style has to appear elegant in all channels. Our </span><a href="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/flatplan-apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlatPlan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> integration system offers The Face the total control over the look and feel they require, in turn allowing them to maintain the integrity of their brand however they see fit.</span></p>
<h2><b>How did we ensure The Face’s goals were met?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We began by considering how Apple News can help meet The Face’s overall goals. Then, we offered their team our hard-earned insights into how best to approach growth with the platform. These conversations revolved around the various types of content The Face publishes. On its site, The Face hosts audio and video content, and it was paramount that these formats be seamlessly incorporated into the publication’s Apple News channel. As such, The Face channel on Apple News contains more audio than any other channel we've seen - an exciting new addition to the platform.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_75907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75907" style="width: 678px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-75907" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/Case-Spooner-audio-excerpt-on-theface.com-BORDER.png" alt="Casey Spooner audio excerpt on theface.com" width="678" height="499"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-75907" class="wp-caption-text">Casey Spooner audio excerpt on theface.com</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique to FlatPlan is the ability to add custom footers below each article so we added a footer to direct their audience to The Face newsletter. This helps them own their audience, and direct them to wherever The Face’s goals must be met:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75921" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-custom-Apple-News-footer.png" alt="The Face's custom Apple News footer" width="678" height="497">All the editorial team need to do to surface stories on Apple News is publish a story to their site, and FlatPlan automatically maps content according to category, so stories are automatically grouped into the relevant section with The Face’s Apple News channel. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e designed page templates to perfectly replicate The Face’s look and feel, and built them to be effective across mobile, tablet and desktop. This assures that The Face’s content portrays their iconic branding, irrespective of platform. Here’s a desktop Apple News story:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75909" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-Apple-News-for-desktop-BORDER.png" alt="The Face's Skepta review on Apple News for desktop" width="678" height="714"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the same story on Apple News for mobile:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75910" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/05/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-Apple-News-for-mobile-BORDER.png" alt="The Face's Skepta review on Apple News for mobile" width="450" height="712"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here it is for tablet:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-75920" src="https://wearemathematics.co.uk/contents/uploads/2019/06/The-Faces-Skepta-review-on-iPad-interface.jpg" alt="The Face's Skepta review on iPad interface" width="678" height="849"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">From a technical perspective Apple News integration usually requires CMS-level development and heaps of QA testing but FlatPlan’s simplicity meant that Mills-Powell was able to say: “To be honest, the integration was so easy on our resource I barely knew it was going on”. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Ideal! Our knowledge of Apple News allowed The Face to make their start with a focus on building a loyal audience. It’s early days, but the team have already earned some great results.</span></span></p>
